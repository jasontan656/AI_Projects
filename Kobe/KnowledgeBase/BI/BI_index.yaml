  AccreditationOfSchoolRepresentativeLiaisonOfficer:
    name: Accreditation of School Representative (Liaison Officer)
    path: KnowledgeBase/BI/AccreditationOfSchoolRepresentativeLiaisonOfficer/AccreditationOfSchoolRepresentativeLiaisonOfficer.yaml
    overview: This service is handled by BI field offices and allows BI-accredited
      schools to nominate and approve school representatives (liaison officers). Approved
      representatives receive a BI-issued ID that is required to process foreign student
      matters, including enrollment reporting, permit applications, and follow-up
      coordination. Processing covers dossier review, payment of fees, and routing;
      once accepted, the field office forwards the file to the Student Visa Section
      for card production and release, and the applicant collects the ID according
      to the release notice.
    applicability_summary:
    - A BI-accredited school needs to designate or replace the staff member responsible
      for foreign student transactions.
    - The school is opening a new campus or has increased volume and must add liaison
      officers to meet compliance and daily processing needs.
    - The current representative has resigned, been reassigned, or the credential
      expired, requiring a personnel change or renewal.
    - The school plans to resume a previously suspended foreign student intake program
      and must re-establish the official liaison credentials.
    - An audit finding or corrective notice requires the school to regularize or replace
      liaison qualifications and documents.
  AccreditedOfficialOfForeignGovernment9E:
    name: Accredited Foreign Government Official (9E) Visa Upgrade and Dependent Annotation
      Guide
    path: KnowledgeBase/BI/AccreditedOfficialOfForeignGovernment9E/AccreditedOfficialOfForeignGovernment9E.yaml
    overview: This service supports foreign government officials formally recognized
      by the Philippine government and endorsed by the DFA, together with their dependents.
      It covers two flows--converting an existing entry class to the courtesy 9E visa
      and filing dependent annotations for family members. The 9E visa generally carries
      no government fees and relies on DFA endorsements and diplomatic notes. Applicants
      must compile the dossier according to the BI CDR checklist; once approved, the
      processing office applies the passport visa annotation and updates BI systems.
    applicability_summary:
    - A DFA-recognized foreign government official in the Philippines must convert
      or upgrade an existing entry privilege to the 9E visa.
    - The official's dependents (spouse, minor children) need BI dependent annotations
      so they can reside with the principal.
    - The official arrived on a short-term visa (such as 9A) and, based on DFA endorsement,
      must upgrade to 9E after entry.
    - A child born in the Philippines to the official requires a processed birth certificate
      and a dependent annotation.
    - Attendants, aides, or domestic staff accompanying the official need aligned
      entry/residence arrangements consistent with the official's status, subject
      to DFA endorsement.
  ACRICardCertification:
    name: ACR I-Card Certification (Grace Period, Record, Cancellation)
    path: KnowledgeBase/BI/ACRICardCertification/ACRICardCertification.yaml
    overview: This service is for holders of Philippine permanent or temporary residence
      visas who already possess an ACR I-Card. The BI Alien Registration Division
      issues an ACR I-Card certification to confirm whether the card is in grace period,
      on record, or cancelled. The certified document provides official proof for
      government agencies, courts, banks, employers, or other third parties during
      compliance reviews.
    applicability_summary:
    - The cardholder is within an approved grace period and needs BI to state the
      card status to support compliance in ongoing transactions.
    - A historical registration record of the ACR I-Card is required for employment
      vetting, bank onboarding, compliance audits, or other official reviews.
    - The card has been cancelled and the applicant must show the cancellation fact
      and effective date to a third party.
    - Court proceedings, government checks, overseas visa applications, or internal
      corporate compliance require an authenticated copy or status certificate from
      BI.
    - Other immigration processes (such as exit clearance, annual report, visa processing)
      need an ACR I-Card status or record certification as supporting documentation.
  ACRICARDIssuance:
    name: ACR I-Card Issuance (Alien Registration Identity Card)
    path: KnowledgeBase/BI/ACRICARDIssuance/ACRICARDIssuance.yaml
    aliases:
    - ACR I-CARD Issuance
    overview: The ACR I-Card is a biometric registration card issued by the BI for
      foreign nationals who stay in the Philippines for more than 59 days. The application
      must be filed together with the corresponding visa case, and the card is encoded
      and released once the visa is approved.
    applicability_summary:
    - Visitors entering on a 9A temporary visitor visa and staying more than 59 days
      must obtain the registration card.
    - When applying for convertible or extendable visas that require registration
      (such as 9G, 13A, 9F student visas), the ACR I-Card must be filed alongside
      the main visa process.
    - Permanent residents who previously held paper ACRs and need to replace or reissue
      the card because of delayed filing.
    - Applications handled by BI-accredited or properly authorized representatives
      who process the visa and registration card on the applicant's behalf.
  ACRICardWaiver:
    name: ACR I-Card Waiver (Approved Grace Period)
    path: KnowledgeBase/BI/ACRICardWaiver/ACRICardWaiver.yaml
    aliases:
    - ACR I-Card Waiver
    - Approved Grace Period
    - Grace Period Waiver
    overview: The ACR I-Card Waiver (Approved Grace Period) is a temporary exemption
      BI issues when an applicant cannot present the ACR I-Card because it is lost,
      stolen, damaged, under renewal, or awaiting release, yet immigration or travel
      transactions must continue. Once approved, it allows lawful processing while
      the card is unavailable and may serve as supporting proof at ports of entry/exit.
      It applies to those granted a grace period or who can reasonably explain why
      the card cannot be shown. BI Main Office handles the filing; after approval
      the applicant must personally claim the waiver with passport and claim stub.
      The waiver remains valid only while the original card is unusable, so the applicant
      should promptly replace or recover the card to stay compliant.
    applicability_summary:
    - The card has been lost or stolen, the incident has been reported or an affidavit
      executed, and immigration or travel transactions must proceed before the replacement
      card is issued.
    - The card is damaged or unreadable (including chip failure) and transactions
      must continue while a replacement card is being processed.
    - The ACR I-Card renewal or re-issuance is in progress and the card is still being
      produced or awaiting release while the applicant needs to extend visas, secure
      an ECC, or travel.
    - The applicant received an Approved Grace Period notice and must depart, arrive,
      or transact with BI within that grace period.
    - Travel is imminent and the card cannot be retrieved or replaced in time; the waiver plus supporting documents (such as ECC or RP/SRC) must be used to depart.
  AdministrativeFineImposedOnAForeignCrewMemberIfNotProperlyDocumented:
    name: Administrative Fine for Foreign Crew with Incomplete Documents (Port Entry)
    path: KnowledgeBase/BI/AdministrativeFineImposedOnAForeignCrewMemberIfNotProperlyDocumented/AdministrativeFineImposedOnAForeignCrewMemberIfNotProperlyDocumented.yaml
    overview: This service covers cases where foreign crew members arrive at Philippine
      ports without a 9(c) seafarer visa or without being listed on the visaed crew
      manifest, and are therefore tagged as improperly documented. By settling the
      administrative fine and associated charges, the vessel regularizes the crew's
      entry and stay status and secures official receipts to show during subsequent
      inspections or follow-on procedures such as waivers, manifest corrections, and
      disembarkation, reducing inspection issues or delays caused by documentation
      gaps.
    applicability_summary:
    - Upon arrival, some or all foreign crew lack 9(c) seafarer visas or are missing
      from the visaed crew manifest.
    - Voyage changes, emergency berthing, or dispatch adjustments require paying the
      fine and related fees at the port.
    - Crew data differ from the visaed manifest (additions, replacements, mismatched
      names or passport numbers) and the discrepancy is confirmed during boarding
      inspection.
    - The vessel or manning agency failed to submit voyage memoranda or itinerary
      documents, leading inspectors to classify the documentation as incomplete.
    - The ship intends to regularize the port status of on-duty or disembarking crew
      (obtaining waivers, disembarkation certificates, etc.) and needs to settle the
      fines and fees at the same time.
  AffirmationOfRecognitionAsFilipinoCitizen:
    name: Affirmation of Recognition as Filipino Citizen and IC Issuance
    path: KnowledgeBase/BI/AffirmationOfRecognitionAsFilipinoCitizen/AffirmationOfRecognitionAsFilipinoCitizen.yaml
    overview: This service is for individuals who already obtained an Identification
      Certificate (IC) from BI but still require affirmation by the Department of
      Justice. By submitting supporting evidence, paying the fees, completing biometrics
      capture, and undergoing review, the Special Inquiry Committee can finalize recognition
      and issue or update the IC so the applicant can assert Filipino citizenship
      in future government transactions.
    applicability_summary:
    - BI has preliminarily recognized the applicant and issued an IC, but DOJ affirmation
      is still pending and must be completed.
    - The applicant claims Filipino citizenship by blood and must prove that a parent
      held Philippine citizenship at the time of birth.
    - The applicant is a minor, and the parents or legal guardian file and describe
      the claim on the child's behalf.
    - The applicant is an adult who will personally submit documents proving parental
      citizenship and the facts of birth.
    - The Special Inquiry Committee issued a compliance notice and additional documents
      must be filed within the prescribed period to continue.
  AmendmentCorrectionOfAdmission:
    name: Amendment/Correction of Admission - Philippine Jurisdiction
    path: KnowledgeBase/BI/AmendmentCorrectionOfAdmission/AmendmentCorrectionOfAdmission.yaml
    overview: This service assists foreign nationals who entered through BI field
      offices in the Philippines but received an incorrect admission class or endorsement
      because required documents were not presented or counter procedures were erroneous.
      By submitting evidence and explanations, the Immigration Regulation Division
      (IRD) issues a corrective order, and the receiving office implements the correction
      on the passport, restoring the proper admission status and stay privileges.
      A corrected admission record keeps later extensions, registration cards, exit
      permits, and visa conversions aligned with system records, preventing overstays,
      denials, or extra reviews.
    applicability_summary:
    - The traveler should have received Balikbayan admission but the counter failed
      to mark, stamp, or encode it, so the entry must be corrected.
    - The traveler entered with a long-term or special visa (e.g., 9G, 13A, 9F, SRRV)
      but the counter omitted the flag, causing the system and passport endorsement
      to disagree with the actual visa.
    - Supporting evidence for accompanying spouse or child (marriage or birth documents)
      was not shown at entry, leading to an incorrect classification that now needs
      correction.
    - The counter mistakenly recorded a non-9(a) status as a temporary visitor or
      another class, and documents now prove the correct category.
    - An erroneous admission recorded in a Philippine sub-port (satellite field office)
      must be elevated to IRD headquarters for approval before the receiving office
      executes the fix.
  AnnualReport_AR:
    name: Annual Report
    path: KnowledgeBase/BI/AnnualReport_AR/AnnualReport_AR.yaml
    overview: Foreign nationals registered with BI and holding an ACR (I-Card or paper
      ACR) must complete the Annual Report within the first 60 days of each calendar
      year to confirm their residence information and pay the prescribed fee; late
      filing incurs a monthly penalty. Minors under 14 may report through a parent
      or legal guardian, and reporting is available via BI counters, virtual annual
      report, or the official mobile annual report channel.
    applicability_summary:
    - Foreign nationals registered with BI and holding a valid ACR I-Card or paper
      ACR must report between January 1 and March 1 (first 60 days).
    - For registrants under 14 years old, a parent or legal guardian must report on
      their behalf.
    - If reporting online, the registrant must review and confirm the system-recorded
      information and retain proof of payment such as the official receipt.
    - Those planning to secure an ECC, depart, or extend a visa should ensure the
      annual report status is updated to avoid issues.
    - Applicants unable to appear in person may use the Virtual Annual Report or participate
      in the official Mobile/Remote AR program when eligible.
  ApplicationForRetentionReAcquisitionOfPhilCitizenship:
    name: Application for Retention/Re-Acquisition of Philippine Citizenship (RA 9225)
    path: KnowledgeBase/BI/ApplicationForRetentionReAcquisitionOfPhilCitizenship/ApplicationForRetentionReAcquisitionOfPhilCitizenship.yaml
    overview: This service assists former natural-born Filipinos who lost Philippine
      citizenship through naturalization in a foreign country. By submitting the required
      documents and taking the oath of allegiance, the applicant re-acquires Philippine
      citizenship and receives the supporting documents (Board Resolution, Order of
      Approval, Identification Certificate). Minor children may be petitioned for
      derivative recognition at the same time.
    applicability_summary:
    - A former natural-born Filipino who became a citizen of another country now wishes
      to retain or re-acquire Philippine citizenship.
    - Children who were minors when the parent re-acquired citizenship under RA 9225
      may be included so long as they are still under 18 at filing.
    - The applicant is registered with BI as a foreign national and needs to update
      records and submit proof of loss of Philippine citizenship.
    - Supporting information across different documents shows inconsistencies (e.g.,
      spelling variants, middle name usage) and must be harmonized through the application.
    - The applicant is presently abroad and cannot take the oath in the Philippines,
      so coordination with Philippine posts or consular offices is required for execution
      and submission.
  BiClearanceCertification:
    name: BI Clearance Certificate
    path: KnowledgeBase/BI/BiClearanceCertification/BiClearanceCertification.yaml
    aliases:
    - BI Clearance Certificate
    - No Record Certificate
    - BI No Record Certificate
    overview: Issued by the Certification and Clearance Section (CCS), this certificate
      confirms whether an individual has unresolved derogatory, watchlist, or pending
      cases within BI systems. It serves as documentary proof requested by courts,
      employers, investment boards, corporate secretaries, or other authorities, and
      the certification fee is collected per transaction.
    applicability_summary:
    - Required before visa conversion, extension, downgrading, or departure clearance
      to show there are no derogatory records.
    - Requested when the applicant will migrate, invest, or conduct business abroad
      and needs to prove a clean BI record.
    - Employers onboarding foreign workers with compliance-sensitive positions may
      ask for the BI clearance certificate.
    - During notarization or consular authentication, the BI clearance can be presented
      as supporting proof of status.
    - If the applicant is overseas and cannot appear, an authorized representative
      with proper SPA or letter of authority may lodge the request.
  CancellationOfAccreditation:
    name: BIAU Accreditation Cancellation
    path: KnowledgeBase/BI/CancellationOfAccreditation/CancellationOfAccreditation.yaml
    overview: When an accredited entity or representative voluntarily ends operations
      or BI orders the revocation of its accreditation, the Bureau of Immigration
      Accreditation Unit (BIAU) formally cancels the privilege. The BIAU issues a
      Cancellation Order that terminates the authority to transact under the accreditation
      and instructs concerned offices to deactivate records.
    applicability_summary:
    - The entity is ceasing the business or service covered by the accreditation and
      must surrender the privilege.
    - There is a change in corporate structure, merger, or dissolution--requiring cancellation
      of the existing accreditation.
    - Key accredited officers or representatives resigned or were dismissed, so the
      organization will no longer maintain the roster.
    - Compliance audits uncovered violations or regulatory findings that require termination
      of the accreditation.
    - The entity intends to apply for a new or different accreditation and must first
      cancel the current one.
  CancellationOfAccreditationIDs:
    name: BIAU Accreditation ID Cancellation
    path: KnowledgeBase/BI/CancellationOfAccreditationIDs/CancellationOfAccreditationIDs.yaml
    overview: When accredited institutions restructure, terminate staff, or replace
      authorized representatives, the Bureau of Immigration Accreditation Unit (BIAU)
      cancels the corresponding accreditation IDs. Upon receipt of documentary requests,
      BIAU issues the cancellation instruction and ensures inactive IDs are recorded
      as void to protect the integrity of transactions.
    applicability_summary:
    - An accredited officer or representative resigns, is terminated, or no longer
      handles BI transactions.
    - The organization appoints new authorized personnel and must deactivate the old
      accreditation IDs.
    - During compliance reviews, the entity must align HR records with the list of
      active accredited IDs.
    - Internal control or audit requirements call for cancelling unused or dormant
      accreditation IDs.
  CancellationOfACRICard:
    name: ACR I-Card Cancellation (De-registration)
    path: KnowledgeBase/BI/CancellationOfACRICard/CancellationOfACRICard.yaml
    overview: Foreign nationals who were issued an ACR I-Card must lodge a cancellation
      when their visa status changes or is terminated. The Alien Registration Unit
      (ARU) updates BI records to ensure admission data stays accurate, and the passenger
      surrenders the card for issuance of the official cancellation receipt. Proper
      cancellation prevents future system discrepancies when applying for visa conversion,
      downgrading, or departure clearance.
    applicability_summary:
    - The underlying visa or permit was cancelled, downgraded, or allowed to expire,
      so the ACR I-Card must also be cancelled.
    - The alien is emigrating or permanently leaving the Philippines and must surrender
      the card before departure.
    - The cardholder has passed away and the surviving relatives or employer are arranging
      for the cancellation.
    - The card was lost but a cancellation with affidavit (and subsequent replacement)
      must still be filed.
    - The alien reacquired or confirmed Philippine citizenship and no longer needs
      the ACR I-Card.
  CancellationOfAlienCertificateOfRegistry_ACR:
    name: Alien Certificate of Registration (ACR) Cancellation
    path: KnowledgeBase/BI/CancellationOfAlienCertificateOfRegistry_ACR/CancellationOfAlienCertificateOfRegistry_ACR.yaml
    overview: When a foreign national's visa is terminated, the individual departs
      permanently, or BI confirms a change in nationality, the Alien Certificate of
      Registration must be cancelled. The BI system records the cancellation so the
      identity file is flagged as inactive, preventing duplicate annual reports or
      unnecessary fees and providing proof for future immigration transactions. (Updated
      per 2025 official guidance.)
    applicability_summary:
    - The underlying visa has been cancelled or downgraded and the corresponding ACR
      must be rendered inactive.
    - The alien has departed and is no longer residing in the Philippines, so the
      ACR file should be closed.
    - BI or a competent authority has affirmed that the individual is now a Philippine
      citizen or has reacquired citizenship.
    - The alien has died and relatives or the sponsoring company must secure cancellation
      of the registry.
    - The ACR I-Card was lost and will not be replaced; cancellation is required to
      stop future obligations.
  CertificateOfNonRegistrationRegistration:
    name: Certification of Non-Registration/Registration
    path: KnowledgeBase/BI/CertificateOfNonRegistrationRegistration/CertificateOfNonRegistrationRegistration.yaml
    overview: This certificate, issued by the Alien Registration Division (ARD), attests
      whether a person has an existing BI alien registration record. It is often required
      by foreign embassies, schools, employers, local government units, or other institutions
      that need proof of immigration registration status. By obtaining the certificate,
      the requester confirms whether a BI record exists and resolves questions about
      compliance or prior filings.
    applicability_summary:
    - A foreign national needs proof of registration status for visa processing, business
      licensing, or other government transactions.
    - Schools or employers onboarding foreign students or workers ask for official
      confirmation of BI registration.
    - Courts, LGUs, or other agencies require documentation of an individual's registration
      history during proceedings.
    - A company preparing compliance or audit submissions wants to verify the registration
      records of foreign hires.
    - An authorized representative is consolidating immigration profiles and must
      obtain the certificate to support the summary.
  CertificationForNotTheSamePerson:
    name: Certificate of Not the Same Person (NTSP)
    path: KnowledgeBase/BI/CertificationForNotTheSamePerson/CertificationForNotTheSamePerson.yaml
    aliases:
    - NTSP
    - Certificate of Not The Same Person
    overview: The Certificate of Not the Same Person (NTSP) is issued when multiple
      immigration records match a traveler's identifiers but refer to different individuals,
      potentially causing watchlist hits, visa holds, or clearance delays. The Certification
      and Clearance Section evaluates the evidence and issues an NTSP to clarify that
      the applicant is distinct from the derogatory record so travel, visa processing,
      or compliance transactions can proceed.
    applicability_summary:
    - During arrival or departure, a watchlist or derogatory hit appears for a similar
      name, requiring proof that the traveler is a different person.
    - Visa conversion, extension, or downgrading reveals database matches that could
      stall processing unless an NTSP is presented.
    - Exit Clearance Certificate (ECC) or other clearances are held pending because
      of identical-name records and need clarification.
    - Airlines or shipping companies flag the passenger's booking due to BI alerts,
      and the NTSP must be submitted to restore clearance.
    - Courts or law-enforcement agencies request a BI-certified statement clearing
      the applicant from mistaken identity cases.
  CertifiedTrueCopyCertification:
    name: Certified True Copy of Derogatory Records
    path: KnowledgeBase/BI/CertifiedTrueCopyCertification/CertifiedTrueCopyCertification.yaml
    aliases:
    - Certified True Copy of Derogatory Records
    overview: BI issues certified true copies of derogatory records when a party needs
      official proof that a derogatory entry exists (or existed) in immigration systems.
      The Certification and Clearance Section prepares the certified copy with embossed
      seals to confirm authenticity, and the document can be presented to courts,
      prosecutors, visa authorities, or investigative bodies.
    applicability_summary:
    - Courts or law-enforcement agencies require a certified copy of derogatory records
      for ongoing investigations or hearings.
    - Visa processing or immigration compliance requires the applicant to disclose
      whether they were flagged under BI derogatory listings.
    - Before applying for clearances, the applicant or representative needs to review
      the historical derogatory entry.
    - The concerned party is overseas and authorizes a representative to obtain certified
      copies for submission.
    - Corporate compliance or due diligence needs documentary proof of whether an
      individual is associated with derogatory records.
  ChildBornAbroadOfImmigrantMother:
    name: Child Born Abroad of Immigrant Mother
    path: KnowledgeBase/BI/ChildBornAbroadOfImmigrantMother/ChildBornAbroadOfImmigrantMother.yaml
    overview: This service converts the admission status of a child who was born abroad
      while the mother held Philippine resident status, so the child can hold the
      same immigrant visa and corresponding ACR I-Card. The process involves pre-assessment,
      payment, document verification, biometrics capture, and card release; required
      documents must be submitted in the prescribed format and timeline.
    applicability_summary:
    - The child enters the Philippines and the mother is an immigrant visa holder;
      the birth occurred while the mother was already a resident.
    - The child has newly arrived and must obtain the same immigrant visa within five
      days of arrival.
    - The child previously entered under a visitor status and now needs conversion
      to the parent's immigrant visa.
    - The family plans to apply simultaneously for the child's ACR I-Card.
    - If a representative files on behalf of the parents, proper authorization documents
      must be presented.

    name: 13C Immigrant Visa for Child Born After Parent's Immigrant Visa Issuance
    path: KnowledgeBase/BI/ChildBornSubsequentToIssuanceOfImmigrantVisaOfAccompanyingParent/ChildBornSubsequentToIssuanceOfImmigrantVisaOfAccompanyingParent.yaml
    overview: This program grants a 13C visa to a child born in the Philippines to
      a parent who already holds a valid immigrant visa (e.g., 13A, 13G, 13Q). It
      allows the child to share the parent's residence status, secure an ACR I-Card,
      and be included in immigration reporting and transactions.
    applicability_summary:
    - The parent holds a valid 13-series immigrant visa and the child was born in
      the Philippines under that status.
    - The child is currently in the Philippines and needs to stay with the immigrant
      parent.
    - The family will obtain an ACR I-Card for the child for use in reporting and

      authority documents.
  ChildBornSubsequenttotheIssuanceofImmigrantVisaoftheAccompanyingParent:
    name: 13C Visa Conversion for Child Born After Parent's Immigrant Visa Issuance
    path: KnowledgeBase/BI/ChildBornSubsequenttotheIssuanceofImmigrantVisaoftheAccompanyingParent/ChildBornSubsequenttotheIssuanceofImmigrantVisaoftheAccompanyingParent.yaml
    overview: This conversion grants a 13C visa to a child born in the Philippines
      after the accompanying parent obtained an immigrant visa, ensuring the child
      holds lawful residence status alongside the parent and receives an ACR I-Card.
      It keeps immigration records consistent for travel, reporting, schooling, and
      healthcare transactions.
    applicability_summary:
    - The child was born in the Philippines after the parent secured an immigrant
      visa, and now needs conversion to 13C.
    - One or both parents hold valid immigrant visas and are legally residing in the
      Philippines, supporting the derivative application.
    - The family wishes to regularize the child's stay, complete visa implementation,
      and obtain the ACR I-Card.
    - The child's information must align with family-based processes such as school
      enrollment, medical coverage, or government registration.
    - The family is filing within the required timeframe to avoid gaps or penalties
      in immigration records.
  ConsultancyOrCorporations:
    name: Consultancy or Corporations Accreditation
    path: KnowledgeBase/BI/ConsultancyOrCorporations/ConsultancyOrCorporations.yaml
    overview: BI grants accreditation to consultancy firms, law offices, human-resource
      agencies, and corporations that regularly transact with the Bureau on immigration
      matters. Accreditation allows designated liaison officers to obtain identification
      cards, post cash bonds when required, and represent clients efficiently for
      visa processing, extensions, or compliance filings.
