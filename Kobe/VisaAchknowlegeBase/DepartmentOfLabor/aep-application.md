# AEP Application

## Summary

The AEP Application is the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) process to secure an Alien Employment Permit for a foreign national sponsored by a Philippine employer. The AEP is commonly required as an eligibility document for BI 9G multi-year work visa filings. This service prepares the DOLE submission documents, handles the public advertisement step (publication in a newspaper when required), tracks DOLE processing, and arranges collection of the AEP card.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet these conditions:

- Geographic prerequisite: DOLE submissions typically require the employer or a local authorized representative in the Philippines. The principal or an authorized representative should be available for any DOLE in-person requirements.
- Relationship prerequisite: The applicant must have a sponsoring employer in the Philippines who provides employer documents and signs required declarations.
- Business prerequisite: Employer must provide company registration documents, employment contract, proof of recruitment efforts (if required), and any supporting corporate evidence DOLE requests.

Not eligible:
- Cases lacking a qualified employer sponsor or where the employer refuses to supply required supporting documents.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** At minimum, allow for the 15-calendar-day publication window plus DOLE processing time; typical practical lead time is several weeks depending on scheduling and batching.

### Step 1: Intake and employer document collection

1. Receive employer corporate documents and the applicant's passport copy.
2. Prepare the DOLE AEP application forms and supporting attachments.

### Step 2: Public advertisement (when required) and DOLE submission

1. Arrange the required public advertisement in an authorized newspaper (publication runs for 15 calendar days in many DOLE workflows).
2. After publication, submit evidence of publication and the complete AEP packet to DOLE.
3. Monitor DOLE and collect the AEP card when DOLE finalizes the permit.

**Notes:** Evidence indicates DOLE filings are operated in batches; one chat excerpt mentioned a "2nd batch" scheduled in the 1st week of August. Confirm DOLE batch schedules at intake.

## Price & Fees

No fixed agent fee recorded in the source evidence for AEP filing. DOLE official fees and publication costs are charged separately and quoted at intake. Typical cost drivers: publication cost, DOLE processing fee, and agent handling fee.

**Evidence-derived operational notes:**
- DOLE publication requires a 15-calendar-day advertisement period before the AEP can progress.
- Internal chat notes referenced timing of AEP batches (example: second batch in the first week of August in one cycle).

---

## Important notes

- DOLE publication is a required step in many AEP cases; plan for the 15-calendar-day wait after advertisement before proceeding to BI filing.
- Employer cooperation is essential; without employer-supplied documents DOLE will not accept the application.
