# AEP Cancellation

## Summary

AEP Cancellation is the formal process to cancel an existing DOLE Alien Employment Permit (AEP) record and, when applicable, obtain an official AEP cancellation certificate. Typical users are employers or departing foreign employees who need to close an active AEP because employment ended, the foreign national is leaving the Philippines, or the employer requests termination of the permit. This task coordinates documentation, submission to DOLE, and collection of any official cancellation certificate used by downstream immigration workflows.

---

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to request AEP Cancellation:

- Geographic prerequisite: The employer or an authorised representative must be available in the Philippines for any DOLE steps that require in-person submission or collection. Remote preparation is possible for document drafting.
- Relationship prerequisite: A sponsoring employer must exist and cooperate (signing the cancellation request) or the AEP holder must authorise the employer/agent to act on their behalf.
- Business prerequisite: The employer must be able to provide corporate documents and the original/clear copy of the AEP card or DOLE reference. If the AEP card is lost, an Affidavit of Loss (filed prior) is typically required before DOLE accepts cancellation.

Not eligible:
- Cases where employer cooperation is unavailable and DOLE requires employer-signed cancellation documents.
- Cases involving enforcement flags (for example active investigations by DOLE) that require legal remediation.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Typically 1–4 weeks depending on DOLE workload and whether a public advertisement or additional employer documents are needed.

### Step 1: Intake and document verification

**Estimated duration:** 1 business day

Actions:
1. Collect employer authorisation, AEP card copy, and the employee passport details.
2. If the AEP card is lost, confirm an Affidavit of Loss has been filed (see Affidavit of Loss service) and collect the affidavit.
3. Provide the client an engagement quote and confirm whether agent will file with DOLE on their behalf.

Needed documents:
- Employer authorisation
- AEP card copy or affidavit of loss
- Passport copy

Notes:
- If employer cannot provide authorisation immediately, cancellation cannot proceed.

---

### Step 2: Prepare submission package and submit to DOLE

**Estimated duration:** 3–10 business days depending on scheduling and DOLE processing cadence

Actions:
1. Draft the DOLE cancellation letter and assemble required attachments.
2. Submit the cancellation packet to the appropriate DOLE office or online channel and pay any DOLE administrative fees.
3. Record submission receipt and monitor DOLE intake confirmation.

Completion sign:
- DOLE issues a submission receipt acknowledging the cancellation request.

---

### Step 3: Track and collect DOLE cancellation certificate

**Estimated duration:** 1–2 weeks (DOLE dependent)

Actions:
1. Follow up with DOLE until the cancellation is processed and the AEP cancellation certificate is issued.
2. Collect the certificate and deliver to the client; provide scanned copies for the client’s immigration records.

Completion sign:
- Client receives DOLE AEP cancellation certificate or official acknowledgement.

## Price & Fees

No fixed universal agent fee is recorded in the source evidence. DOLE official fees (if any) and any courier or processing charges are payable in addition to the agent handling fee. Quote at intake based on complexity and whether affidavit or record retrieval is required.

**Price notes:**
- If the AEP card is lost, an additional affidavit step (cost varies) may be required before DOLE will cancel the AEP.

---

## Important notes / Risks

- If the AEP card is lost, DOLE commonly expects an affidavit of loss and may delay cancellation until identity and record are reconciled.
- Employer cooperation is essential; DOLE will not cancel an AEP without proper employer instruction in many cases.
- The DOLE AEP Cancellation Certificate is often required by Bureau of Immigration workflows (for example downgrade and clearance); advise clients to retain the DOLE cancellation proof.
