# AEP Card and Employment Period Adjustment

## Summary

This service corrects or amends the printed employment period on a Department of Labor (DOLE) AEP (Alien Employment Permit) card so that the AEP record and the physical AEP card align with immigration practice and limits. Typical use cases: when an AEP card shows an employment period inconsistent with immigration application rules (for example appearing to exceed the allowed maximum application period of two years) or when internal records must be reconciled for downstream Bureau of Immigration (BI) filings.

Who needs this: employers or foreign employees who hold an AEP card with an employment period that must be corrected to comply with immigration rules or to match BI/DOLE records. When to use: before filing BI-dependent applications or when the AEP card is required as an input for a 9G multi-year visa or other immigration filings.

This service includes review of the existing AEP card, preparation of the amendment request, liaison with DOLE (or the AEP-issuing office) and returning the corrected AEP card to the client.

## Background prerequisites

Client must meet the following conditions to use this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal (applicant or authorised company representative) should be physically present in the Philippines for any required in-person submission or card collection. Some preparatory advisory work can be done remotely but DOLE often requires originals or in-person signatures for formal amendments.
- Relationship prerequisite: The requester should be the AEP cardholder or an authorised employer representative. Employer cooperation is typically required for requests that modify employer-related data.
- Business prerequisite: The client must possess the original AEP card (or an official copy) and a valid passport. If the AEP card is missing the client must procure an Affidavit of Loss and/or obtain a certified copy via the appropriate DOLE/agent processes before this amendment task can proceed.

Not eligible:
- Cases where the AEP card is cancelled and no longer active - these require a different DOLE workflow (AEP re-issue or re-application).
- Cases where DOLE policy or law prohibits retroactive changes of the employment period — the agent will advise and propose alternative remediation where possible.

## Documents the client must provide (must be provided by client)

### Required originals (client must provide)

**AEP Card (original):**
- Type: original × 1
- Required: yes
- Requirement: Present the original AEP card issued by DOLE. The original will be borrowed for submission and returned when DOLE releases the corrected card (unless DOLE retains it by policy).
- How this business uses it: We use the original to verify the printed employment period and to submit the amendment request to DOLE or to the issuing office.

**Passport (original or copy):**
- Type: original × 1 (for in-person submission) or clear scanned copy for intake
- Requirement: Passport bio page and visa pages to confirm identity and immigration records.
- How this business uses it: Identity verification and to cross-check dates against immigration/BI records.

**Employer authorisation (if employer requests):**
- Type: original or signed scanned copy × 1
- Requirement: Employer letter authorising the agent to request the AEP amendment on behalf of the company/principal.

### If original AEP card is lost

- Affidavit of Loss (AEP): notarised affidavit describing loss circumstances. The agent can assist drafting the affidavit, but the client must sign and notarise it.
- If the AEP card is lost we will coordinate with DOLE on whether the certified copy + affidavit is sufficient to request an amendment or whether a re-issue procedure is required.

## Outcome — documents obtained after completion

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Variable. Typical timeline: 1–4 weeks depending on DOLE processing schedules and whether a re-issue (rather than a simple amendment) is required.

### Step 1 — Intake and verification

**Estimated duration:** 0.5–1 business day

Specific actions:
1. Client provides the original AEP card, passport, and employer authorisation (if relevant).
2. Agent verifies the printed employment period on the AEP card and compares it with immigration/BI requirements (immigration rule: maximum application period typically limited to 2 years).
3. Agent confirms the target corrected employment period with the client. Example from chat evidence: adjust the period to March 9, 2020 — June 30, 2022.

**Documents needed:** AEP card original, passport, employer authorisation (if applicable).

**Notes:** If the AEP card is missing, proceed to the Affidavit of Loss sub-flow before attempting amendment.

### Step 2 — Prepare amendment request

**Estimated duration:** 1–3 business days

Specific actions:
1. Draft the formal Amendment Request Letter addressed to DOLE (or the issuing office). Include justification referencing immigration rules that cap the application period and request explicit correction to the employment period printed on the card.
2. Prepare supporting documents: passport copy, AEP copy, employer letter (if employer-initiated), evidence showing the correct period (for example employment contract, BI/immigration records) where available.
3. If DOLE requires a fee for amendment or re-issuance, calculate and prepare payment evidence as directed by DOLE.

**Completion sign:** A complete amendment packet is ready for submission.

### Step 3 — Submit amendment to DOLE / issuing office

**Estimated duration:** DOLE processing varies — same day submission; adjudication may take days to weeks.

Specific actions:
1. Submit the amendment packet to DOLE in-person or via DOLE-authorised channels. Provide originals if DOLE requires physical submission.
2. Pay any official DOLE fees and collect submission receipt. Record case reference for follow-up.
3. Monitor DOLE processing status and respond promptly to DOLE requests for additional evidence or clarifications.

**Completion sign:** DOLE issues an acknowledgement and processes the amendment.

### Step 4 — Collect corrected AEP card and close case

**Estimated duration:** When DOLE returns the corrected card (variable)

Specific actions:
1. Collect the corrected AEP card from DOLE or arrange delivery to the client.
2. Verify that the employment period printed on the returned card matches the requested corrected period (e.g., March 9, 2020 — June 30, 2022).
3. Deliver the corrected card and DOLE acknowledgement to the client and close the case.

**Possible issues and mitigations:**
- If DOLE requires re-issuance rather than a minor amendment, additional processing time and fees may apply. Agent will advise and obtain client instruction to proceed.
- If DOLE declines amendment due to policy constraints, agent will propose alternative remediation (for example issuing a formal DOLE note for BI submission or coordinating with BI to accept other evidence).

## Price & Fees

No fixed agent price is recorded in source evidence for this specific amendment task. DOLE official fees, processing or re-issuance fees (if any) are charged by DOLE and are additional. Agent handling fees depend on scope (drafting, representation, return delivery) and will be quoted at intake.

**Price notes:**
- Expect additional costs if a full re-issue of the AEP card is required rather than a simple amendment.
- If the AEP original is lost and an Affidavit of Loss plus certified copy retrieval is required, those tasks incur separate costs.

---

## Important notes / Risks

- Immigration (BI) practice sets limits on application period lengths. DOLE amendments that result in employment periods longer than allowed by immigration rules may be rejected downstream by the Bureau of Immigration. Always confirm both DOLE and BI acceptance of the corrected period when planning visa filings.
- DOLE may require originals for card re-issuance and may retain originals during processing; clients should avoid planning travel that requires the passport during the amendment period unless an emergency plan is in place.
- If the AEP card is lost, secure an Affidavit of Loss and obtain certified copies to avoid delays.
