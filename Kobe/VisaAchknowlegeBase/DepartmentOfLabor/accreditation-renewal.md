# Accreditation Renewal

## Summary

Accreditation Renewal is the administrative process to renew a company's accreditation with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) or related DOLE unit. Typical users are employers and HR teams whose existing accreditation is due to expire and who must file updated documentation, obtain the DOLE accreditation checklist, and prepare for possible office inspection and employee verifications. The service coordinates retrieval of the DOLE checklist, prepares the submission packet, helps the client prepare for site and personnel inspections, and files the renewal application before expiry to avoid service interruption.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to request Accreditation Renewal:

- Geographic prerequisite: The employer or an authorized representative must be available in the Philippines to sign forms, attend DOLE counters if required, and to host any on-site inspection. Some preparatory document review can be done remotely, but DOLE often requires originals or local attendance for final submission.
- Relationship prerequisite: The requester must be the employer (company representative), HR officer, or an authorised representative nominated by the employer and supported by a written authorisation letter.
- Business prerequisite: The company must hold the expiring accreditation and be the subject of the renewal request; the agent must have access to the current accreditation record and corporate documents needed for renewal.

Not eligible:
- Companies that have had accreditation revoked or are under active DOLE enforcement where a renewal would be inappropriate. Such cases require remediation before a renewal can proceed.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Varies by DOLE queue and local workload; plan to submit at least several weeks before expiry. If the accreditation expires on a fixed date, start the process 30–60 days in advance.

### Step 1: Obtain DOLE Accreditation Checklist

**Estimated duration:** 1 day (client to obtain from DOLE) or agent assist by visiting DOLE

**Actions:**
1. Request or collect the official accreditation checklist from DOLE or the relevant DOLE online portal.
2. Review the checklist and identify the required attachments and any inspection requirements.

**Needed documents:** none beyond the company's identity — agent can help retrieve if authorised.

**Notes:** The checklist is mandatory and drives the entire renewal submission.

---

### Step 2: Prepare the submission packet and pre-inspection checklist

**Estimated duration:** 2–7 business days depending on document readiness

**Actions:**
1. Map each DOLE checklist item to the client's supplied documents; prepare certified copies where required.
2. Draft the submission cover letter and organize documents in the order requested by DOLE.
3. Produce the Office Inspection Preparation Note: ensure premises, records, and nominated staff are ready for inspection. Prepare staff to present IDs and payroll records if required.

**Needed documents:** Accreditation Checklist, company registration, payroll/employee records as required.

**Completion sign:** Final submission packet reviewed and signed by authorised company representative.

### Step 3: File the renewal with DOLE and arrange follow-up

**Estimated duration:** DOLE processing time variable (same day submission; processing may take weeks)

**Actions:**
1. Submit the packet in person or via the DOLE portal (according to DOLE's process) and pay any official processing fees if required.
2. Record the submission receipt and case reference.
3. If DOLE schedules an office inspection or employee interviews, coordinate attendance or representation and supply requested originals at the inspection.
4. Monitor DOLE processing and respond promptly to any requests for additional evidence.

**Completion sign:** DOLE issues renewed accreditation certificate or formal acknowledgement.

## Price & Fees

No fixed agent fee or DOLE official fee is recorded in the available evidence. Official DOLE charges (if any) and agent handling fees vary by scope and whether an on-site inspection is required. Confirm fees at intake.

**Price notes:**
- If DOLE requires an on-site inspection, anticipate modest additional time and potential travel or representation fees.
- Agent will provide a customised quote depending on document volume and whether agent attends DOLE in person on behalf of the company.

---

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Processing limitations
- DOLE retains absolute administrative discretion. Renewal may be conditional, require corrective actions, or be denied if DOLE finds compliance issues.

### Timing requirements
- Start the renewal well before the expiry date (example evidence: accreditation expires July 28). Late submission risks service interruption or penalties.

### Risk warnings
- Expect DOLE to request original documents during submission or inspection; originals may be temporarily held by DOLE.
- If DOLE discovers non-compliance during inspection (wage issues, missing filings), additional remedial work and fees will be required and could delay the renewal.
