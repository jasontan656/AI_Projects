# AEP Application Justification Letter

## Summary

This service prepares a tailored Justification Letter used to support a Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) Alien Employment Permit (AEP) application. The letter explains why the employer must hire a foreign national for a specific role, identifying required skills, language capabilities, or specialized experience not available in the local labor market. Typical clients are employers preparing an AEP submission, in-house HR teams, or immigration agents who need a professionally drafted original letter ready for DOLE review and inclusion in the AEP package.

**Estimated duration:** 0.5 day

Specific actions:
1. Client submits the Contract of Employment, job description, company profile, and any candidate CVs or evidence of recruitment efforts.

### Step 2: Drafting the letter

**Estimated duration:** 0.5–1 day

Specific actions:
1. Prepare a first draft of the Justification Letter in English, structured to address DOLE's typical concerns: role summary, recruitment steps taken, lack of available local talent, specific foreign candidate qualifications, and duration of employment.
2. Emphasise verifiable facts: salary competitiveness, training time required, language necessity, or unique technical certifications.
3. Provide the draft to the client for review and corrections.

**Completion sign:** Client confirms content and provides formal approval to produce the original letter.

### Step 3: Finalise, sign and deliver

**Estimated duration:** 0.5–1 day

Specific actions:
1. Produce the final original letter on company letterhead and arrange the authorised signatory to sign the original.
2. If requested, coordinate notarisation or legalisation steps required by DOLE or supporting offices.
3. Deliver the signed original and an editable digital copy to the client for inclusion in the AEP submission packet.

**Completion sign:** Client receives the original signed Justification Letter and confirms delivery instructions (for example submit to DOLE or include in AEP packet prepared by the agent).

## Important notes / Restrictions

- The Justification Letter must be truthful and supported by evidence. DOLE may request to see supporting documents (recruitment evidence, company documents) when reviewing the AEP application.
- The letter should align exactly with the job title and duties described in the Contract of Employment; inconsistencies are a common reason for DOLE queries or delays.
- If the client asks the agent to submit the original to DOLE on their behalf, a signed authorisation from the employer will be required.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Who signs the Justification Letter?
A: The authorised signatory of the employer (for example company CEO, HR head or authorised representative) should sign the original. The agent can prepare the draft and coordinate execution.

Q: Can you prepare the letter in a foreign language?
A: The letter should be in English for DOLE filing. If another language is required for any reason, an English translation should be included.

Q: Will DOLE accept a generic template?
A: DOLE expects a tailored explanation addressing specific reasons why a local hire cannot fill the position; generic templates are often inadequate.
