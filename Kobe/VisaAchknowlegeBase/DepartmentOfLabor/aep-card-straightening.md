# AEP Card Straightening

## Summary

AEP Card Straightening is a simple, one-off service that restores a physically bent or warped DOLE AEP (Alien Employment Permit) card to a flat, presentable condition suitable for use and presentation to government offices. Typical customers are cardholders whose issued AEP plastic card has been accidentally bent during handling or transit and who require a low-risk repair to return the card to a usable condition. The service is a light mechanical restoration only — it does not alter card data or replace the card.

---

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to use this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The card (original AEP card) must be physically available in the Philippines at the agent or repair location. The repair requires handling of the original plastic card.
- Relationship prerequisite: The requester must be the cardholder or an authorised representative with written permission to hand over the physical card for temporary repair.
- Business prerequisite: The original AEP card must be present and in possession of the client or provided to the agent for the straightening procedure.

Not eligible:
- Cards that are cracked, delaminated, scratched beyond aesthetic repair, or otherwise physically damaged such that the printed data, holograms, or security features are compromised. Those cases require replacement via DOLE AEP re-issue/cancellation workflows rather than simple straightening.
- Requests where the original card cannot be temporarily surrendered for handling (for example urgent travel that would be blocked if the card is held). The agent may offer supervised on-site minor straightening where permitted.

## Required documents

### Documents the client must provide (must be provided by client)

**AEP Card (original):**
- **Type:** original × 1
- **Requirement:** The physical DOLE AEP card issued to the beneficiary. The card must be produced and handed to the agent for the mechanical straightening procedure.
- **How used:** The card is temporarily borrowed for the straightening process and returned to the client after completion. The card is non-consumable and will be returned.

**Authorization (if a representative hands over the card):**
- **Type:** copy of signed authorization × 1
- **Requirement:** A signed letter from the cardholder authorising the named representative to hand over and later collect the AEP card. Required when the agent receives the card from a third party.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Typically 15–60 minutes for a straightforward flattening; allow same-day turnaround if scheduling permits.

### Step 1: Intake and damage assessment

**Estimated duration:** 5–10 minutes

1. Verify the cardholder identity (passport or ID) and record authorization if a representative handed the card.
2. Inspect the card and assess the severity of bending, warping, or surface deformation. Confirm that holograms, printed text, and plastic layers are intact and that the card is suitable for mechanical straightening.
3. If the card is structurally compromised (cracked or delaminated) advise the client that a replacement (DOLE AEP re-issue) is required instead.

**Documents needed:**
- AEP card (original)
- Authorization letter (if applicable)

**Notes:**
- If the card will be held for a short time, obtain the client's written consent for temporary custody during repair.

---

### Step 2: Prepare materials and workstation

**Estimated duration:** 2–5 minutes

1. Prepare a clean, flat workspace and the following materials: thick cardstock or plain clean paper, lint-free cloth, low-temperature flat iron (hair straightener or clothes iron with temperature control), soft flat weight (e.g., a book wrapped to avoid scratching), and a towel.
2. Set the flat iron to the lowest safe temperature that still yields mild heat (test on a plastic sample or service cloth first). Avoid any high heat setting.

**Safety note:** No chemical solvents or adhesives are used. The procedure relies on controlled gentle heat and mechanical flattening only.

---

### Step 3: Straightening procedure

**Estimated duration:** 5–20 minutes (depends on bend severity)

1. Place the thick cardstock (or two layers of paper) on the work surface. Place the card face-up on the paper and cover with another thin cloth or paper layer to protect printed surfaces.
2. Apply the flat iron BRIEFLY (1–3 seconds at a time) over the covered card area while maintaining even pressure; do not let the iron sit in one spot. Rotate and repeat as necessary to allow the plastic to relax. Keep the iron movement steady and at low heat.
3. Immediately after gentle heating, sandwich the card between a pair of flat boards or heavy books (with protective paper between card and boards) and leave under weight for 5–10 minutes to set the card flat as it cools.
4. Remove and inspect. If necessary, repeat brief heat-and-press cycles with caution until the card is acceptably flat.

**Quality checks:**
- Confirm that printed data, holograms, and lamination remain visually intact and not distorted.
- Verify the card sits flat on a tabletop with no significant bounce or camber.

**If any damage is observed during the procedure, stop immediately and document the issue; advise the client on AEP card replacement options.**

### Step 4: Return and handover

**Estimated duration:** 5 minutes

1. Prepare a short repair log noting: date/time, method used, staff who performed the action, and any observations.
2. Return the card to the client (or authorised representative). Obtain client signature acknowledging receipt and acceptance.
3. Provide care instructions (avoid bending, store in card sleeve) and a brief advisory to check the card at the next official transaction.

## Price & Conditions

| Effective Date | Currency | Amount | Applicable Conditions | Notes |
|---------------:|:--------:|------:|----------------------|------|
| 2025-10-17 | PHP | 500 | Minor flattening service (same-day) | Agent handling fee example; confirm at intake. Official DOLE fees are not applicable for a mechanical repair. |

**Price notes:**
- The mechanical straightening service is a cosmetic repair only and does not replace or reissue official DOLE documentation. If the card is materially damaged or if the repair fails, AEP card replacement must be pursued via formal DOLE procedures (AEP re-issue / cancellation).
- The quoted fee above is an example estimate. Final price is quoted at intake depending on complexity and custody duration.

---

## Attention & Risk Warnings

### Handling limitations
- Do not apply high heat; excessive heat can delaminate lamination, distort holograms, or melt plastic structures rendering the card invalid.
- If the card has cracks, missing laminates, or visible security feature disruption, do NOT attempt straightening; recommend formal replacement.

### Time requirements
- Same-day service is normally possible for minor bends. For more cautious handling (client requests photography, documentation, or witness signing) allow additional time.

### Risk disclaimer
- The agent performs non-destructive mechanical restoration only. The agent is not altering data or security features intentionally. The client accepts minor residual deformation risk inherent to physical repair.
