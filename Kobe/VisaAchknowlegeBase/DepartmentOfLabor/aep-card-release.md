# AEP Card Release

## Summary

AEP Card Release is a focused operational service to monitor, collect and deliver the Department of Labor (DOLE) Alien Employment Permit (AEP) plastic card once DOLE has approved an AEP application. Typical users are employers, HR teams or agents who have filed an AEP and need the physical AEP card as an input for downstream immigration filings (for example 9G BI submissions) or to provide to the beneficiary employee. This task tracks DOLE status, coordinates collection, and confirms safe handover to the client.

---

## Background prerequisites

Clients must meet the following conditions to use this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: An authorised representative or the cardholder must be available in the Philippines for final collection if DOLE requires in-person pickup. Remote monitoring is possible but physical collection commonly requires local presence.
- Relationship prerequisite: The requester must be the employer, the named beneficiary, or an authorised agent with written permission to collect the AEP card on behalf of the principal.
- Business prerequisite: The underlying AEP application must be approved by DOLE and the AEP card produced. This service does not cause DOLE approval — it handles monitoring and card collection only.

Not eligible:
- Cases where DOLE has not approved the AEP or where the application is still in the publication period. In those cases, use the AEP Application service to complete filing and wait for DOLE issuance.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Typically same-day to a few business days after DOLE confirms the card is ready for pickup.

### Step 1: Verify DOLE issuance status

**Estimated duration:** same day

**Actions:**
1. Use the DOLE application reference or DOLE online status to confirm the AEP card has been produced and is ready for collection.
2. If DOLE indicates collection is ready, schedule an appointment or collection slot with DOLE as required.

**Needed documents:** DOLE reference or submission receipt.

**Notes:** DOLE often uses a short internal turnaround between approval and physical production; allow time for DOLE printing and case routing.

### Step 2: Prepare for collection

**Estimated duration:** same day

**Actions:**
1. Prepare the authorised collector with the required ID documents and the authorised letter (if the collector is an agent).
2. Confirm DOLE counter hours, any payment or stamping required at pickup and any copy retention rules.

**Needed documents:** authorisation letter (if agent collects), ID of collector, DOLE reference.

### Step 3: Collect the AEP card at DOLE

**Estimated duration:** minutes at the counter (allow queue time)

**Actions:**
1. Present the authorisation and ID at DOLE counter. Confirm the card serial number and the beneficiary name before taking custody.
2. Obtain an official DOLE release slip or stamp where provided. Photograph the card face and back for internal verification if the client authorises it.

**Completion sign:** Agent holds the official DOLE release slip and the AEP card.

### Step 4: Deliver the card and close the case

**Estimated duration:** same day or arranged delivery

**Actions:**
1. Deliver the AEP card to the beneficiary or authorised recipient and obtain a signed handover receipt.
2. Provide the client with the agent collection note, DOLE reference and a short advisory about storing the card and using it for BI filings.

**Completion sign:** Client confirms receipt and signs the handover receipt.

## Price & Fees

No fixed universal fee is recorded. Typical agent fee depends on whether the agent performs local collection, negotiates courier delivery, or performs expedited liaison. DOLE does not charge a separate release fee beyond standard AEP issuance fees. Confirm collection fee during intake.

---

## Important notes / Risks

- DOLE may require the physical presence of the beneficiary in some cases for identity verification. Confirm DOLE collection rules at intake.
- Keep the AEP card secure: it is an official employment permit required by BI for downstream visa filings.
- If DOLE retains the card temporarily for stamping or verification, inform the client and obtain written status updates.
