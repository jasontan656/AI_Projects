# Board Resolution for DOLE Registration

## Summary

A Board Resolution for DOLE Registration is a short standalone legal administrative task to prepare a company Board Resolution (or, where permitted, a notarized Special Power of Attorney) required by the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) when the corporate entity registers or renews employer credentials, obtains company-level permits, or files employment-related submissions. Typical users are corporate clients who need an original, signed, and notarized Board Resolution authorizing a named company officer or representative to sign DOLE applications, accept AEP cards, or perform DOLE-related transactions on the company's behalf.

This service prepares the final Board Resolution or a template SPA, coordinates client signature and notarization, and delivers the notarized original to the client for inclusion in the DOLE application package.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to request this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal corporate signatory or an authorised representative must be available in the Philippines to sign and notarize the Board Resolution (or to instruct an authorised signatory). Remote drafting and coordination are available, but the notarization step is usually local.

- Relationship prerequisite: The requester must be an authorised company officer (e.g., corporate secretary, director) or an authorised representative with a valid corporate authorization (board resolution or power of attorney) acceptable to the company and DOLE.

- Business prerequisite: The company must be a registered corporate entity in the Philippines and must have authorised signatories as per corporate by-laws. If the company is not already registered or lacks corporate signature authority, the Board Resolution cannot be produced until corporate governance formalities are satisfied.

**Not eligible:**
- Entities without legal corporate authority or those that cannot provide an authorised signatory for notarization.
- Requests that require court orders or other judicial interventions (this service only prepares the administrative Board Resolution or SPA for DOLE use).

## Documents required

### Documents the client must provide (cannot be produced by this service)

**1) Company Details and Authorized Signatory Evidence**
- Type: copy × 1
- Requirement: A copy of company registration (SEC/DTI registration or equivalent), company name, registered office address, and identification of the authorized officer(s) (name, position). The agent uses these details to draft the exact corporate clause in the Board Resolution.
- How used: Populated into the Board Resolution template. Original corporate documents may be requested by DOLE during submission and must be produced by the client.

**2) Proof of authority (if required by company policy)**
- Type: copy × 1
- Requirement: Existing board minutes or secretary's certificate if the company has internal rules requiring an approving corporate resolution before a specific officer may be authorized. If the company uses a standard template and corporate secretary sign-off, provide the relevant proof.
- How used: Verifies corporate governance compliance before drafting the final Board Resolution.

### Documents this service prepares or can produce

**1) Board Resolution (original to be signed)**
- Type: original × 1
- Producer: Board Resolution for DOLE Registration
- Path: DepartmentOfLabor/board-resolution-for-dole-registration.md
- Usage: A formal Board Resolution in the company's official letterhead that authorizes a named representative to file with DOLE and to act for DOLE matters; prepared in editable form for client review before printing and signing.

**2) Special Power of Attorney (SPA) (optional)**
- Type: original × 1
- Producer: Board Resolution for DOLE Registration
- Path: DepartmentOfLabor/board-resolution-for-dole-registration.md
- Usage: Where a Board Resolution is impractical and corporate rules permit, the SPA is drafted as an alternative. The SPA must be signed and notarized; it grants limited authority to a named individual to act with DOLE on behalf of the company.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Typically 1–3 business days from draft to notarized original depending on client responsiveness and local notary availability.

### Step 1 — Intake and drafting

**Estimated time:** Same day (hours)

1. Client submits company name, registration number (SEC/DTI), registered address, full name and position of the authorised signatory, and a contact email for the signer.
2. We draft a tailored Board Resolution (or SPA alternative) in editable format using the supplied corporate details.
3. Send the draft to the client for review and legal/management approval.

**Needed documents:** Company registration copy, identity of authorised officer.

**Note:** If the company requires an internal board meeting to approve the resolution, the client must follow their internal governance rules before we finalize the signed original.

### Step 2 — Client review and signature

**Estimated time:** 0.5–1 business day (depends on signer availability)

1. Client reviews the draft and requests any minor edits. We incorporate changes and prepare the final printable version on company letterhead (if provided) or on a standard template.
2. Arrange for the authorised signatory to sign the Board Resolution (in-person or in a controlled signing session). Ensure the signer brings valid government ID.

**Needed documents:** Final draft and signer's ID.

**Note:** The company should retain an internal copy of the signed resolution for corporate records.

### Step 3 — Notarization

**Estimated time:** same day to 2 days (based on notary availability)

1. Coordinate local notarization: we can arrange a notary appointment for the signer or advise the client to visit their preferred notary. The signed original is notarized per local practice.
2. For overseas or consular needs, advise on additional legalization (DFA authentication or apostille) if the receiving agency requires it.

**Needed documents:** Signed original, signer's valid ID.

**Note:** Notarisation must be performed by a licensed notary public; additional consular legalization is an optional extra and not included unless requested.

### Step 4 — Deliver notarized original to client and include usage notes

**Estimated time:** same day after notarization

1. Deliver the notarized original to the client via secure courier or in-person collection.
2. Provide a short advisory note describing how the Board Resolution or SPA should be presented in the DOLE filing package and confirm common DOLE expectations (for example that the resolution authorizes filing, receipt of AEP cards, and signage of documents).

**Completion sign:** Client receives a notarized original ready for submission to DOLE.

## Price & Fees

- Drafting service: nominal drafting fee quoted at intake (varies by firm). Typical one-off drafting fee is modest; please request a quote.

- Optional additional legalization (DFA authentication or Apostille): additional fee and lead time; quoted on request.

**Price notes:** No fixed DOLE filing fee is charged by this service. This business prepares the resolution—DOLE application fees remain separate.
