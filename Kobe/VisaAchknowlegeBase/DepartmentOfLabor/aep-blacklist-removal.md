# AEP Blacklist Removal

## Summary

This service helps foreign workers and employers resolve an AEP-related blacklist record (blacklisted AEP) by identifying the authoritative order file, preparing legal representation, and handling an appeal or formal request to the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) and related offices to remove the blacklist. Typical clients are principals whose AEP record was flagged/blacklisted due to employer or administrative issues and who need a lawyer-led remediation to clear the record before pursuing future AEP or BI filings.

---

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to use this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: Client or authorised representative should be available in the Philippines for document handovers and any in-person submissions that DOLE or BI requires. Some advisory steps can be started remotely but legal filings often require local representation.
- Relationship prerequisite: The requester must be the AEP holder (principal), the sponsoring employer, or an authorised representative with signed authority accepted by the lawyer and DOLE/BI.
- Business prerequisite: The client must provide identity evidence (passport) and attempt to locate the original AEP order file that records the blacklist. If the order file is missing the service will retrieve a certified copy from BI records before proceeding.

Not eligible:
- Cases where the client lacks any verifiable identity details or refuses to authorise legal representation where needed.
- Cases requiring litigation beyond administrative appeals; those will be referred to specialist immigration counsel.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Highly variable; initial assessment and order retrieval typically 1–2 weeks; lawyer appeal and DOLE processing can take several weeks to months depending on complexity and whether additional hearings are required.

### Step 1: Intake & case assessment

**Estimated duration:** 1–3 business days

Specific operations:
1. Collect passport and any available order file or chat evidence that references the blacklist.
2. Confirm the blacklist type and source (DOLE AEP blacklist vs BI blacklist) and whether an AEP order exists.
3. If the order file is missing, authorise retrieval and proceed to Step 2.

**Needed:** passport copy, any cited order references, signed POA if representation is intended.

**Notes:** Early legal intake identifies deadlines, jurisdiction (DOLE or BI), and whether a rapid interim remedy (for example a stay or request for administrative hold) is possible.

### Step 2: Retrieve authoritative order copy (if needed)

**Estimated duration:** 3–14 business days depending on BI records workload

Specific operations:
1. If the AEP/BI order file is not available, submit a 9G Order Copy Request to BI to obtain a certified true copy of the relevant order or record.
2. Use the certified copy to confirm the reason for blacklisting and to prepare the legal grounds for appeal.

**Needed:** signed authorisation for record retrieval (if required by BI), passport number, name and sponsor details.

### Step 3: Legal consultation and preparation

**Estimated duration:** 3–10 business days

Specific operations:
1. Engage the lawyer for case review. Lawyer drafts the legal appeal/complaint addressing the factual and legal grounds for removal (for example mistaken employer data, administrative error, or submitted evidence of remedy).
2. Lawyer prepares supporting exhibits: employment contracts, corrected employer statements, payment evidence (if fines settled), and certified order copy.

**Needed:** payment authorisation for lawyer retainer, any missing corporate or employment evidence.

### Step 4: Submission and follow-up with DOLE / BI

**Estimated duration:** Variable (weeks to months)

Specific operations:
1. Lawyer files the appeal or remedial application with DOLE (or BI if the blacklist is recorded by immigration), serves required parties and tracks the administrative docket.
2. Attend hearings, follow-up with official correspondences, provide clarifying evidence and, if required, settle fines or remedial conditions.
3. Obtain written confirmation of blacklist removal or a formal resolution outlining next steps.

**Completion sign:** Issuance of an official DOLE/BI letter or amendment in the relevant database indicating blacklist removal.

## Risks & Important Notes

### Processing limitations
- Blacklist removal is an administrative process with no guaranteed outcome; success depends on the factual record and the agency's discretion.
- Some cases may require partial remedies (paying outstanding fines, obtaining employer confirmations) before removal is considered.

### Time sensitivity
- Act quickly once a blacklist is discovered. Delays can compound enforcement consequences (travel denial, arrest, or escalation of flags).

### Evidence requirements
- A clear authoritative order file is essential to determine the cause and the proper filing route. If the order file is missing, retrieval from BI records is usually the first practical step.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Who files the appeal — DOLE or BI?**
A: It depends on which agency recorded the blacklist. If the AEP/blacklist is a DOLE administrative entry, DOLE channels apply; if the record is on BI immigration systems, BI/immigration appeal channels are required. The case intake clarifies jurisdiction.

**Q: How long does removal take?**
A: Ranges widely — from a few weeks for straightforward administrative corrections to several months for contested cases requiring hearings.

**Q: What if the blacklist is due to unpaid fines?**
A: Often the remedial path is to settle fines and provide proof of payment; in some cases settlement plus legal submissions can secure removal.
