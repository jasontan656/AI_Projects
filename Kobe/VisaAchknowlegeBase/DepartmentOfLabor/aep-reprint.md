# AEP Reprint

## Summary

AEP Reprint is a short, stand-alone service to request a reprint of a DOLE Alien Employment Permit (AEP) plastic card when the issued card contains an incorrect or unacceptable photograph. Typical users are AEP cardholders whose printed photo does not match the accepted 2x2 photo standards and whose card must be reissued to correct the image. The service handles intake of the correct 2x2 photograph, submission to the DOLE printing/compliance channel, monitoring of the reprint, and delivery or collection of the corrected AEP card.

---

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to request an AEP reprint:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal (cardholder) or an authorised local representative should be in the Philippines when DOLE requires in-person collection or final identity verification. Intake and submission can often be initiated remotely with clear scanned documents.
- Relationship prerequisite: The requester must be the AEP cardholder or an authorised employer/agent acting with written authorization to handle the card reprint request.
- Business prerequisite: An existing AEP card must have already been produced by DOLE and the issue is limited to the printed photograph mismatch. If the card is missing, lost, or otherwise damaged beyond the photograph issue, other services (Affidavit of Loss, AEP Cancellation, or AEP Re-issue) may be required.

Not eligible:
- Cases where the AEP card has been lost or physically destroyed — those require the Affidavit of Loss and replacement workflows.
- Cases involving data changes other than the photograph (for example name or employment period corrections) — those are handled through AEP amendment or re-issuance processes.

## Documents the client must provide (must be provided by client)

### Required from the cardholder

**2x2 photograph (correct version)**
- Type: original × 1
- Requirement: A clean, clear 2x2 photograph that meets DOLE/BI specifications (neutral background, recent, frontal pose). The client must supply the correct original photo (or a high-quality digital image if accepted by the printing/compliance unit).
- How used: Submitted to DOLE/printing team to replace the incorrect printed image on the AEP card.
- Custody: Photo will be consumed for printing (digital file may be kept in case file if client authorises).

**AEP Card (current, for inspection)**
- Type: original × 1 (returned after the process)
- Requirement: The physical AEP card with the incorrect photograph must be available for inspection and cross-checking. DOLE may request to retain or collect the original during production — the agent will confirm custody rules at intake.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Typically 1–3 business days for submission and monitoring; DOLE production and release timing may vary and can extend to several working days depending on DOLE workload.

### Step 1: Intake and verification

**Estimated duration:** same day

**Actions:**
1. Collect the correct 2x2 photograph from the client and a clear scan/photo of the existing AEP card.
2. Verify the photograph meets DOLE/BI photo specifications and confirm the reprint reason (wrong picture printed / low quality / mismatched identity).
3. Obtain written authorisation from the cardholder or employer where an agent will submit the reprint request.

**Documents needed:** 2x2 photograph, scan of current AEP card, signed authorisation if agent acts.

**Notes:** Confirm whether DOLE requires the original card to be surrendered for reprinting or whether a digital submission is sufficient.

### Step 2: Prepare the reprint submission

**Estimated duration:** same day

**Actions:**
1. Prepare a brief cover letter explaining the reason for reprint and attach the correct 2x2 photo and justificatory scans.
2. Send the package to the DOLE printing/compliance email or deliver it to the printing unit according to DOLE instructions (for example the printing compliance inbox used by the office).
3. Request an acknowledgement or production ETA from the DOLE printing/compliance team.

**Completion sign:** Receipt or acknowledgement from DOLE confirming the reprint request is accepted.

### Step 3: Monitor production and collect the reprinted card

**Estimated duration:** 1–7 business days (DOLE dependent)

**Actions:**
1. Monitor DOLE production status and follow up until the reprinted card is ready for release.
2. Collect the card from DOLE or arrange a secure courier / authorised representative to pick up per DOLE release rules.
3. Verify the reprinted AEP card details and photograph match the submitted 2x2 photo and the cardholder identity.
4. Deliver the corrected card to the cardholder and close the case.

**Completion sign:** Cardholder confirms receipt of the corrected AEP card and provides acceptance signature.

## Price & Conditions

| Effective Date | Currency | Amount | Applicable Conditions | Notes | Evidence |
|---------------:|:--------:|------:|----------------------:|------:|---------:|
| 2022-09 | PHP | 3,000 | Fee for AEP card reprinting due to incorrect photograph | Agent handling/production coordination fee as recorded in chat evidence; official DOLE printing/production charges (if any) are additional | messages 229146, 230722 |

**Price notes:**
- The PHP 3,000 figure is the agent-reported operational fee shown in the original chat evidence. Confirm the current total quote at intake because DOLE printing costs or courier charges may be extra.
- Government printing fees (if any) and courier charges are not included and will be billed separately when applicable.

---

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Processing limits
- DOLE has discretion to accept or reject reprint requests; in some cases DOLE may require card cancellation and a full re-issue instead of a simple reprint if other card data is inconsistent.
- If the AEP card is lost or damaged beyond the photograph issue, the correct workflow is Affidavit of Loss and replacement rather than a reprint.

### Time and custody
- DOLE or the printing office may require temporary custody of the original AEP card during production; the agent will document chain of custody and expected release schedule.
- Do not plan travel that requires immediate use of the AEP card while the reprint is in production without contingency.

### Risk warnings
- Submitting an incorrect or non-compliant photograph will lead to rework and additional fees; ensure the 2x2 photo meets the required specifications before submission.
