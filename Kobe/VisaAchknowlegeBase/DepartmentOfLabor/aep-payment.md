# AEP Payment

## Summary

AEP Payment is the service that handles the financial transactions and receipts required to obtain or finalise a Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) Alien Employment Permit (AEP). Typical users are employers sponsoring foreign hires, human resources teams, payroll/HR agents, and immigration representatives who must confirm, collect and submit official DOLE fees, newspaper publication costs (when applicable), and any agent handling fees necessary to complete an AEP application or AEP-related process.

This service ensures the correct amount is paid to DOLE and related vendors, produces verifiable payment evidence for the AEP application packet, and coordinates payment reconciliation with employer accounting and downstream immigration filings.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions before AEP Payment can proceed:

- Geographic prerequisite: Payments may be initiated remotely (bank transfer) but final delivery of official receipts or payment proofs often requires a local representative in the Philippines. For some payment channels DOLE requires in-person payment at their cashier or at an authorised bank counter.
- Relationship prerequisite: The payer must be the employer, employer-authorised representative, or an authorised payroll/immigration agent who can lawfully transfer funds on behalf of the employer. Written authorisation may be required for agent-managed payments.
- Business prerequisite: An AEP application must be prepared or in-progress; AEP Payment requires the DOLE reference or application details to allocate the payment correctly. If publication is required, the advertisement invoice must also be paid and included in the application package.

Not eligible:
- Anonymous payments or payments without an assigned DOLE application reference (these cannot be attached to an AEP application and will cause processing delays).

## Required documentation

### Documents the client must provide (cannot be produced by this service)

- Payment instruction or invoice:
  - Type: copy × 1
  - Requirement: A written instruction from the employer or application lead that specifies the DOLE reference (if available), the beneficiary account, the exact amount to pay, and any internal cost center or reference that the payer expects on the receipt.
  - How used: This instruction is attached to the payment evidence and used to reconcile payments with employer accounting.

- Employer authorisation:
  - Type: original or scanned signed authorisation × 1
  - Requirement: Confirms the authorised person or agent is permitted to make payments and to receive the official receipt on behalf of the employer.

- AEP application reference and candidate details:
  - Type: digital copy × 1
  - Requirement: Applicant name, passport number and DOLE application reference (if already issued). Used to ensure the DOLE receipt can be matched to the correct AEP application.

### Documents the service can produce

- Payment proof package (producer: AEP Payment):
  - document: Payment confirmation PDF and internal payment note
  - path: DepartmentOfLabor/aep-payment.md

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Same day to several business days depending on payment channel used and bank clearing times. Typical remote bank transfer confirmations are same-day; official DOLE receipt issuance may be immediate at DOLE cashier or require processing time when paid via third parties.

### Step 1: Confirm the payable amount and beneficiary details

**Estimated time:** hours

1. Confirm the official AEP fee schedule and whether publication or other third-party charges apply for the specific application case.
2. Ask the employer to provide the DOLE application reference (if available), preferred payment method (bank transfer, cash deposit, DOLE cashier), and internal invoice code for reconciliation.
3. Provide the payer with a final payment instruction including bank account details, exact amount, and payment reference format to ensure receipts are traceable.

**Needed documents:** payment instruction; AEP application reference

**Notes:** Always confirm the amount with the filing agent or DOLE contact before initiating the transfer to avoid underpayment or misallocation.

### Step 2: Make the payment and collect proof

**Estimated time:** same day (depends on payer)

1. Payer executes the payment according to the agreed channel (bank transfer screenshot, deposit slip, online instruction, or in-person DOLE cashier payment).
2. Collect official proof: bank transfer confirmation, scanned deposit slip, or DOLE official stamped receipt. If paying for advertisement, obtain the newspaper invoice and the publication proof plus payment receipt.
3. Attach payer ID and authorisation if the payer is not the employer.

**Completion sign:** Payment evidence in hand (scanned and timestamped).

### Step 3: Reconcile and produce the payment evidence package

**Estimated time:** same day to 1 business day

1. Agent verifies the payment reference, amount and beneficiary name. Reconcile any bank fees, foreign exchange differences or intermediary charges and record the net amount received.
2. Produce the Payment Proof Package: a single PDF containing the transfer screenshot, deposit slip photo, official DOLE receipt (if returned immediately), and a short reconciliation note addressed to the AEP application.
3. Deliver the package to the AEP application owner (for attachment in DOLE submission) and to employer accounting for bookkeeping.

**Completion sign:** Payment Proof Package delivered to relevant stakeholders.

### Step 4: Follow-up and receipt confirmation

**Estimated time:** 1–3 business days (if DOLE issues receipt later or if third-party publication invoices are slow)

1. If the DOLE official receipt was not immediately available (for example when paying via bank channel requiring DOLE processing), monitor DOLE status until the official receipt is issued and collected.
2. If needed, agent collects the DOLE receipt or publication receipt on behalf of the employer with prior authorisation and updates the payment package.
3. Confirm final reconciliation and close the payment task in the case file.

**Notes:** Retain copies of all receipts for downstream BI filings where DOLE payment evidence is required.

## Price & Fees

| Effective Date | Currency | Amount | Applicable Conditions | Notes | Evidence |
| -------------- | -------- | ------:| -------------------- | ----- | -------:|
| 2020-11 | PHP | 56,000 | Quoted AEP payment observed in chat evidence (example case) | Payment for AEP processing and associated costs as recorded in source chat. Confirm current official DOLE fees at intake. | message 24620 |

**Price notes:**
- The PHP 56,000 entry is an extracted operational example from chat evidence. DOLE official fees are set by DOLE and are often much lower; the higher figure likely includes agent handling, publication fees, courier, and service charges. Always confirm the exact breakdown during intake.
- Bank transfer intermediary fees and currency conversion costs (for foreign employers) are additional and should be charged to the payer unless otherwise agreed.

---

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Payment timing and sequencing
- DOLE publication and some AEP processing steps require evidence of payment and publication before DOLE proceeds. Delays in payment or in producing official receipts will delay the AEP timeline.

### Proof of payment requirements
- DOLE and downstream BI may require the original official receipt. If a scanned bank transfer is used temporarily, obtain the DOLE receipt as soon as it becomes available.

### Risk warnings
- Pay only to confirmed DOLE banking details or DOLE-authorised payment channels. Fraudulent account instructions have been observed in market practice; always verify account details using a second trusted channel.
- Misallocated or unlabeled payments can take additional administrative time to reconcile and may delay the application.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Who typically pays the AEP fees?
A: The employer usually pays DOLE AEP fees, publication costs and agent handling fees for employer-sponsored AEP applications. The payer must provide a clear payment instruction and authorisation.

Q: Why is the example amount in chat much higher than DOLE official fees?
A: Chat-extracted amounts commonly include agent service fees, publication costs, and courier or handling charges. Always request an itemised quote at intake to separate government fees from service fees.

Q: Can I pay by bank transfer from overseas?
A: Yes, but confirm the beneficiary account details, currency arrangement and the requirement to pay any intermediary fees. Ensure the transfer reference includes the DOLE application reference to ease reconciliation.
