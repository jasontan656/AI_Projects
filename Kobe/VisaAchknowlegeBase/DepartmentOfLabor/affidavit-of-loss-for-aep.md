# Affidavit of Loss (AEP)

## Summary

An Affidavit of Loss (AEP) is a formal sworn statement filed when a DOLE AEP card (Alien Employment Permit card) is lost or stolen. The affidavit documents the circumstances of the loss, supports replacement or cancellation workflows, and is commonly required by DOLE and BI as part of AEP cancellation, AEP reissuance, or related immigration processes. This service drafts the affidavit, coordinates notarisation, and prepares supporting documents for submission to DOLE or the police (if a police report is required).

## Background prerequisites

Clients must meet the following conditions to request and file an Affidavit of Loss for an AEP card:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal (AEP card holder) should be present in the Philippines to sign the affidavit before a notary public. Remote drafting is possible, but most jurisdictions require in-person signing or a legally recognised e-notarisation method.
- Relationship prerequisite: The person filing must be the AEP cardholder or an authorised representative with documented authority.
- Business prerequisite: Provide as much supporting information as possible: passport number, AEP card number (if known), last known possession details, and any evidence of attempted recovery.

Not eligible:
- Cases where the principal refuses to provide a truthful sworn statement or cannot attend to sign the affidavit as required under local notarisation rules.

## Price & Fees

No uniform public fee is recorded for drafting an affidavit. Notarisation fees and police report filing fees are payable locally. Agent assistance fees for drafting and coordination are quoted at intake.

**Price notes:**
- Notary fees vary by locality.
- If the client requests the agent to file a police report or courier documents to DOLE/BI, additional handling charges apply.

---

## Important notes / Risks

- Truthfulness: An affidavit is a sworn legal statement; the client must provide accurate information. False statements in an affidavit can have legal consequences.
- Police report: DOLE or BI may require a police report for a lost/stolen government-issued card; filing the police report is the client’s responsibility but the agent will provide templates and guidance.
- Timing: If the AEP is to be cancelled or replaced quickly, prioritize drafting and notarisation to avoid delays in downstream immigration actions.
