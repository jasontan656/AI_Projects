# AEP Printing and Compliance

## Summary

AEP Printing and Compliance is a focused operational service that prepares and submits documents required by the DOLE printing/compliance team to produce Alien Employment Permit (AEP) materials. The service ensures BIR Form 1904 files are stamped and packaged together with required 2x2 photos, verifies file naming and scan quality, and delivers the complete packet to the compliance email or printing division for production checks. Typical users are HR teams and immigration agents coordinating final AEP card printing and compliance checks.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to use this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The documents and originals must be accessible in the Philippines for scanning, stamping or courier handover. Remote coordination is possible for electronic scans, but originals are sometimes required by the compliance/printing unit.
- Relationship prerequisite: The requester should be the sponsoring employer, HR representative, or an authorised immigration agent able to collect and submit the required official forms and photos.
- Business prerequisite: The AEP application must have been prepared and any upstream steps (for example DOLE AEP application or payment) should be in place. This service prepares the printing/compliance packet, it does not itself obtain the AEP approval.

Not eligible:
- Requests that lack the required original forms (BIR Form 1904) or the named individual photos. Without the originals or high-quality scans we cannot complete the compliance packet.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Typically same-day to 2 business days depending on availability of originals and courier schedules.

### Step 1: Intake and document verification

**Estimated time:** 0.5–2 hours

Specific actions:
1. Confirm the list of beneficiaries and the exact quantity of BIR Form 1904 originals required per person.
2. Request or collect the 2x2 photographs (ensure Meng Lin or other named person photos are present where specified).
3. Verify that all BIR forms are stamped and correctly completed; flag any missing stamps or signatures and request client remediation.

**Needed documents:** BIR Form 1904 originals, 2x2 photos.

**Notes:** Poor-quality forms or unsatisfactory photos will be rejected by the printing/compliance team; perform an early QC check.

---

### Step 2: Scanning, naming and quality control

**Estimated time:** 0.5–3 hours depending on volume

Specific actions:
1. Scan each stamped BIR Form 1904 at high resolution (300 dpi or higher) and create a standard filename convention: `Surname_GivenName_BIR1904.pdf` and `Surname_GivenName_2x2.jpg` for photos.
2. Run a checklist to confirm all pages are oriented correctly, readable, and all required stamps are visible.
3. Produce a single compliance ZIP or PDF package for submission.

**Completion sign:** Scanned package assembled and QC passed.

---

### Step 3: Submission to printing/compliance

**Estimated time:** same day (email transmission) or 1–2 days if couriering originals

Specific actions:
1. Send the compliance package to the designated compliance email (example: tssdepww.compliance@gmail.com) with a clear subject line and body note listing included files and contact for follow-up.
2. If originals are required by the printing division, arrange a secure courier handover and record chain-of-custody.
3. Confirm receipt and note any additional requests from the compliance team (for example additional photos or re-stamping).

**Completion sign:** Compliance team acknowledges receipt and confirms next steps for printing.

## Price & Fees

No fixed retail price is recorded in the available source evidence. Typical fee components include:
- Agent handling and QC fee (quoted per packet)
- Courier fees for original handover (if required)
- Any printing production fees charged by the printing division (paid directly or included per arrangement)

**Price notes:** Confirm the final quote at intake since quantities and courier options materially change the cost.

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Operational cautions
- Ensure all scanned files are clearly named and verified before sending — printing/compliance teams frequently reject poorly named or low-quality scans.
- If the printing division requires originals, arrange secure courier and obtain written confirmation of chain-of-custody.

### Compliance risk
- Missing required stamps on BIR Form 1904 will cause printing delays; do not submit until all stamps and signatures are confirmed.
- Photos must meet the 2x2 specification; non-conforming photos will cause rework.
