# AEP Application for Wei, Shuzhen

## Summary

This case-specific service manages the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) Alien Employment Permit (AEP) application for one named principal: Wei, Shuzhen. We will collect the required employer and applicant documents, pay the DOLE application fees on behalf of the case if requested, arrange the mandatory public advertisement (when applicable), submit the AEP application to DOLE, monitor the DOLE process and, when issued, collect and deliver the AEP card to the client. Typical usage: employer-sponsored foreign worker who needs a formal AEP as a prerequisite for multi-year BI 9G filings or other immigration procedures.

This solo task is a one-case instance of the generic AEP Application service. It is intended for the single named principal and provides end-to-end case handling: payment, DOLE publication coordination, DOLE submission, and card collection.

## Background prerequisites

Customer (Wei, Shuzhen) and sponsor must meet the following conditions:

- Geographic prerequisite: Agent or the client (or an authorised representative) must be able to transact in the Philippines for any in-person DOLE steps, collection of the AEP card, or publication coordination.
- Relationship prerequisite: A Philippine employer sponsor must exist and supply required corporate documents and sign the employer declarations.
- Business prerequisite: The employer must be willing to provide the corporate and payroll evidence required by DOLE; the applicant must have a valid passport and present identity/immigration evidence.

Not eligible:
- Cases without an employer sponsor or where the employer refuses to provide corporate documentation.
- Cases where the employer or applicant cannot meet DOLE documentary requirements (for example missing company registration records) — remedial corporate work is required first.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Minimum several weeks in practice. DOLE publication normally requires 15 calendar days after advertisement and DOLE processing adds additional time.

### Step 1: Intake and payment instruction

**Estimated duration:** Same day to 1 business day

**Actions:**
1. Confirm contact details, employer sponsor details and obtain scanned passport and employer documents.
2. Provide a service quote and DOLE fee estimate. If the client requests agent payment handling, collect payment instruction or deposit to proceed.
3. If payment is required to start publication or DOLE filing, instruct client to pay the AEP application fee or accept agent-collected payment.

**Needed documents:** passport scan, employer documents, signed employer authorization to file.

**Notes:** Chat evidence indicates a request to pay the application fee for Wei, Shuzhen (see Evidence section). Agent will record a payment confirmation and attach the payment evidence to the DOLE packet.


### Step 2: DOLE public advertisement and AEP submission

**Estimated duration:** 15 calendar days (publication) + DOLE processing time

**Actions:**
1. Arrange the required public advertisement (15 calendar days when applicable) and collect proof of publication for the DOLE application.
2. Complete DOLE AEP application forms, attach the employer corporate documents, employment contract, advertisement proof (when publication required), and remit DOLE official fees.
3. Submit the complete package to DOLE and collect the DOLE submission receipt.

**Completion sign:** DOLE acknowledges receipt of the application and the publication proof; DOLE issues a submission receipt or tracking reference.


### Step 3: Monitoring DOLE and card collection

**Estimated duration:** several days to a few weeks depending on DOLE workload

**Actions:**
1. Monitor DOLE processing, answer any DOLE queries and supply additional documents promptly if requested.
2. When DOLE issues the AEP card, the agent collects the physical AEP card or coordinates collection with the employer.
3. Deliver the AEP card to the client or the authorised representative and provide a final case report with DOLE receipts.

**Completion sign:** Client receives the AEP card and DOLE final receipt.

## Price & Fees

No fixed public agent fee is recorded specifically for this named case. DOLE official fees and publication costs apply and are payable to DOLE or the publication vendor. Agent handling fees (payment facilitation, publication coordination, filing and monitoring) are quoted at intake.

**Price notes for intake:**
- DOLE publication and official DOLE fee: charged by DOLE / publication channel (quoted at intake).
- Agent handling fee: quoted based on scope (document preparation, payment handling, and card pickup).

---

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Processing limitations
- DOLE timing: Expect a minimum 15-calendar-day publication window when advertisement is required. DOLE batch schedules may add further delays.
- Employer cooperation: The sponsor must provide corporate and payroll documents to satisfy DOLE requirements.

### Time-related considerations
- Start early: DOLE publication time and processing time mean a multi-week lead time. Begin the case as soon as employer signs approval and documents are available.
- Do not schedule dependent BI filings until the AEP card is issued and physically available if the downstream BI filing requires the AEP card as a mandatory input.

### Risks
- Missing or incorrect sponsor documents can delay DOLE approval or cause rejection; verify corporate documents before submission.
- Policy changes: DOLE and BI policy can change; reconfirm the AEP requirement for the downstream BI filing at intake.
