# BIR Filings

## Summary

BIR Filings is a single-purpose administrative service to process and pay Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) forms and fees on behalf of a client. Typical use-cases include paying multiple BIR submission fees that require in-branch bank payments, collecting the official forms (originals) for submission, scanning the paid forms and delivering scanned copies to internal or external stakeholders. This service manages in-person bank transactions, handles transaction limits by splitting payments across multiple banks when necessary, secures official receipts, and produces scanned evidence for record-keeping and downstream compliance.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions before this service can proceed:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal or an authorised representative must be available in the Philippines for in‑branch payments or to provide originals when required by the process. Remote advisory and coordination are possible, but in-branch bank payments and original-form handling are inherently local tasks.
- Relationship prerequisite: The requester must be the document owner or an authorised representative with a signed authorization acceptable to the client party and any receiving stakeholders.
- Business prerequisite: Client must provide the original BIR forms to be paid (these originals are required inputs and in the documented case are collected by the agent and not returned). The client must also confirm the total amount to pay and authorize the agent to execute multiple bank transactions if needed to respect per-bank transaction limits.

Not eligible:
- Cases where the client cannot provide the original BIR forms or cannot arrange local representation when BI/banks require presence.

## Required documents (must be provided by client)

These items must be provided by the client and cannot be produced by this service.

**BIR Forms (payment copies)**
- Type: original × 3
- Requirement: The physical BIR forms that require payment and stamping. The source case indicates three originals are required; adjust quantity to the real case at intake.
- How used: Originals are submitted for payment at accredited banks and are typically collected by the handling agent or the BIR process. In the extracted evidence the forms are collected and not returned to the client.
- Consumable attribute: The originals may be retained by the agent for submission to the payee or by BIR procedures as part of the filing.

**Authorization to act (if using a representative)**
- Type: original signed letter or power of attorney × 1
- Requirement: When a representative will attend banks and handle forms, the signed authorization should permit the agent to execute payments and collect forms/receipts on the client’s behalf.

---

## Documents produced by this service

**Scanned BIR Forms**
- Type: scanned PDF copies × 3
- Produced by: BIR Filings
- Usage: Official scanned evidence of paid forms for internal records and to send to stakeholders (for example Miss Aiza in the documented case).

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Typically 1 day to a few days depending on the number of forms, bank queues and transaction limits. If multiple banks are required, allow additional travel and processing time.

### Step 1: Intake & verification

**Estimated duration:** 0.5–2 hours

Specific actions:
1. Collect the original BIR forms from the client (3 originals in the example). Verify form completeness and confirm the total payable amount.
2. Confirm the bank payment plan with the client: total amount, whether split across banks is needed due to transaction limits, and who will sign/authorise the bank receipts.
3. Obtain signed authorization if the client uses a representative.

**Needed documents:** BIR forms (originals), payer identification, authorisation letter (if applicable)

**Notes:** Confirm the per-bank transaction constraints before travel (the example evidence shows a bank limit on BIR payment transactions).

---

### Step 2: Execute bank payments (field operations)

**Estimated duration:** Several hours depending on number of banks and travel time

Specific actions:
1. Visit accredited banks per the plan and pay each form or portion of the total as instructed. Use the client’s approved payment method.
2. Take official bank receipts for each transaction. For transparency, record the bank teller name, counter, date/time, and transaction reference for each payment.
3. If more than 10 transactions are needed at a single bank, split payments across multiple banks or plan aggregated transactions according to the bank's operational limits.

**Needed documents:** Originals of BIR forms for stamping/payment, proof of payment funds

**Notes:** The example evidence indicates that a single bank allows only 10 BIR payment transactions; the total amount (PHP 68,000) was split across multiple banks to respect this limit.

---

### Step 3: Scanning and delivery of evidence

**Estimated duration:** 0.5–1 hour

Specific actions:
1. After each form is paid and stamped, scan each completed form at high resolution (PDF), and label files with date, bank and reference number.
2. Compile scanned PDFs and scanned payment receipts into a single encrypted ZIP (if requested) or attach to a secure email.
3. Deliver scanned copies to the designated recipient(s) (example: Miss Aiza) and confirm receipt and sufficiency of evidence.

**Outputs:** Scanned BIR Forms × 3, combined payment receipts PDF

---

### Step 4: Reconciliation and case closure

**Estimated duration:** 0.5–1 day

Specific actions:
1. Reconcile submitted payments against the client’s instruction and produce a short reconciliation note listing amount per bank, transaction references and final totals.
2. Provide the client with the originals (if returned) or a final statement indicating which originals were consumed and which were returned. In the documented case the forms were collected and not returned; this must be confirmed with the client at intake.
3. Archive digital evidence and update the client case file.

**Completion sign:** Client confirms receipt of scanned forms and payment reconciliation; case closed.

## Price & Fees

| Effective Date | Currency | Amount | Applicable Conditions | Notes |
|---------------:|:--------:|-------:|----------------------|------|
| 2025-02 | PHP | 68,000 | Total payment recorded in chat evidence (example case) | Total payable to government for the set of BIR filings; agent handling fees are additional and must be quoted at intake. |

**Pricing notes:**
- The PHP 68,000 figure is the operational total recorded in the source chat (2025-02) for a particular set of BIR filings. This is a case-specific government payment total, not an agent fee.
- Agent handling fee (administrative / travel / scanning) must be agreed and charged in addition. Bank transaction fees or e-payment processing charges (if applicable) are separate and borne by the payer.

---

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Bank transaction limits
- Some banks restrict the number of BIR payment transactions per account or per teller (example: bank allows only 10 transactions for BIR payments). Plan the payment split accordingly to avoid rejected transactions.

### Originals custody
- Confirm whether originals will be returned. The documented evidence indicates that the specific forms were collected and not returned. Obtain explicit client consent before surrendering documents that will not be returned.

### Security and privacy
- Store scanned forms and payment receipts securely. When sending scanned documents, use encrypted channels or password-protected archives as they contain sensitive tax and financial information.

## Common questions

**Q: Can we pay all forms at once with a single transfer?**
A: Not always. Many BIR payments require in-branch transactions and banks may impose per-transaction or per-day limits. Pre-check with the receiving banks to determine feasibility and plan the split.

**Q: Will the bank return my forms after payment?**
A: Practices vary. Discuss custody terms before submission. In the documented example the originals were collected and not returned; the client must accept this outcome.
