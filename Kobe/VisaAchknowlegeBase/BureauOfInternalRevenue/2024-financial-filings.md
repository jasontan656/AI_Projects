# 2024 Financial Filings

## Summary

This service helps clients compile, verify, scan, and deliver all Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) filings and related payroll and VAT documents for the calendar year 2024. Typical users are businesses or authorized representatives who have completed or hold the original 2024 BIR forms (monthly/quarterly VAT returns, payroll withholding summaries, and any year-end reporting). The service assembles the documents, performs a completeness and basic accuracy check, scans all originals to high-quality PDF, compresses the scanned files into a single encrypted ZIP archive if requested, and sends the archive to the client's designated email address. The deliverable is a zipped folder containing scanned copies of all 2024 filings and an email confirmation of delivery.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to use this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: This task can be performed remotely where the client can provide physical access or courier the originals to the service provider in the Philippines. If originals remain in the client's custody and the client supplies high-quality copies, remote processing is possible. For onsite collection or notarized handover, the agent must be able to operate locally in the Philippines.
- Relationship prerequisite: The requester must be the taxpayer (company) or an authorized representative with acceptable authority documents (for example board resolution, special power of attorney) to collect or handle tax documents on behalf of the taxpayer.
- Business prerequisite: The client must possess or be able to provide all required BIR forms for 2024 that they want compiled and scanned (for example monthly/quarterly VAT returns, monthly payroll withholding returns, SSS/PHIC/HDMF remittance stubs if requested as part of payroll package). If audited financial statements or other third-party documents are part of the requested package and those documents are produced by separate accounting/audit engagements, the client must provide those originals.

Not eligible:
- Cases where the client cannot provide any copies or physical access to the 2024 filings and no authorized representative is available to collect them locally.
- Requests that require substantive tax preparation, filing, or audit services rather than document compilation and scanning (those are separate service categories).

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Typically 1–5 business days after receipt of all documents, depending on document volume and whether physical pickup is required.

### Step 1: Intake and scoping

**Estimated duration:** 0.5–1 business day

Specific actions:
1. Client requests the 2024 Financial Filings service and provides an inventory or description of the documents to be compiled.
2. Service provider issues a scope confirmation and a chain-of-custody instruction (if physical pickup is required), including courier instructions and security measures.
3. Client authorizes the representative (if needed) and confirms the email recipient address for the ZIP delivery.

**Needed documents:** authorization (if representative), preliminary file list from client.

**Notes:** The provider will not begin scanning until authorization and delivery logistics are confirmed.

---

### Step 2: Collection / receipt of documents

**Estimated duration:** Same day to 2 business days depending on courier and location

Specific actions:
1. Receive the originals or copies from the client or authorized representative (in person or via secure courier).
2. Verify identification and authorization documents and log receipt into the chain-of-custody record.
3. Triage the documents and note any missing or damaged items; notify the client immediately.

**Completion sign:** Chain-of-custody log updated and documents ready for scanning.

---

### Step 3: Verification and scanning

**Estimated duration:** 0.5–3 business days depending on volume

Specific actions:
1. Conduct a basic completeness check against the client's inventory (not a substantive tax audit) to ensure all forms expected for 2024 are present.
2. Scan each document at agreed quality settings (for example 300dpi PDF/A), perform OCR if requested, and name files according to the agreed naming convention (e.g., "2024-VAT-Q1-CompanyName.pdf").
3. Create an index (manifest) listing each scanned file, page count, and brief description.

**Possible issues and mitigations:**
- Problem: Low-quality originals produce poor scans.
  - Solution: Notify client and request re-supply or consent to enhanced image processing which may increase time/cost.
- Problem: Missing forms discovered during intake.
  - Solution: Advise client which forms are missing and offer optional retrieval services if available.

**Completion sign:** All documents scanned and manifest produced.

---

### Step 4: Packaging, encryption, and delivery

**Estimated duration:** 0.5 business day

Specific actions:
1. Compress scanned PDFs into one ZIP archive. If requested by the client, apply password protection using a password communicated via a separate secure channel.
2. Attach the ZIP to an email addressed to the client's designated recipient(s). Include the scan manifest and delivery confirmation.
3. Optionally upload the ZIP to a secure file share (for example encrypted cloud storage) and provide a download link with expiry controls.

**Completion sign:** Email sent with attachment and service provider retains a delivery confirmation copy.

---

### Step 5: Return of originals and closure

**Estimated duration:** Same day to 2 business days depending on courier

Specific actions:
1. Return physical originals to client or to the designated address by secure courier, unless the client has expressly authorized retention for further processing.
2. Update the chain-of-custody log and close the job with a final job report summarizing files included and delivery evidence.

**Completion sign:** Client acknowledges receipt of the ZIP and the returned originals (if applicable).

## Price & Fees

No fixed public price is recorded in the available source evidence. The service provider will quote fees based on the following factors:
- Document volume (number of pages and number of distinct forms)
- Whether physical pickup and return courier service is required
- Any required image enhancement, OCR, or password-encryption
- Urgency / expedited turnaround

Price notes:
- Official BIR filing fees or penalties are not included in this service (this service only compiles and scans existing filings).
- A sample quote will be provided at intake once the document volume and logistics are known.

---

## Important notes and restrictions

### Handling of originals
- Originals will be handled with documented chain-of-custody procedures. Unless otherwise instructed in writing, originals will be returned to the client after scanning.
- If the client instructs the agent to retain originals for subsequent filing tasks, the client must provide explicit written authorization and accept associated custody risk/terms.

### Scope limitations
- This service does not prepare or file tax returns with the BIR; it only compiles, verifies basic completeness, scans, and transmits the client's 2024 financial filing documents.
- For tax preparation, audit, or representation before the BIR, clients should request the appropriate accounting, audit, or tax-filing services.

### Data protection
- Scanned files and delivery proofs will be stored temporarily by the service provider under agreed retention and security policies. Sensitive information should be redacted only if the client instructs so in writing prior to scanning.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Can you file the scanned documents to BIR on my behalf?
A: Not under this service. This package only compiles and scans existing 2024 filings. Filing to BIR requires specific tax-filing or accounting services and proper authorizations; we can refer or add those services upon request.

Q: Will you return my original documents after scanning?
A: Yes. Originals are returned by default via secure courier, unless you expressly authorize retention for additional services.

Q: Can you OCR the scanned PDFs so they are searchable?
A: Yes. OCR is available as an optional add-on and may affect turnaround time and cost.
