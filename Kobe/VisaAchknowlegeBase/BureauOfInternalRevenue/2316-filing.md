# 2316 Filing

## Summary

2316 Filing is the preparation and submission of BIR Form 2316 (Statement of Compensation Payment/Tax Withheld) for employees. This service helps employers compile payroll withholding records and issue Form 2316 copies to employees and to the Bureau of Internal Revenue as required by regulation. Typical clients are employers or payroll agents who must provide employees with official withholding tax statements and ensure the employer's filing obligations are met. The core operational deadline extracted from source evidence is February 28 each year.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions before we can perform 2316 Filing:

- Geographic prerequisite: Employer or authorized representative should be able to transact with the Bureau of Internal Revenue in the Philippines or use an accepted electronic filing channel where available.
- Relationship prerequisite: The requester must be the employer, payroll administrator, or an authorized representative with acceptable authority to submit tax forms on behalf of the employer.
- Business prerequisite: Payroll and withholding tax computation for the covered tax year must be completed and supporting payroll records must be available.

Not eligible:
- Individuals requesting their own 2316 when no employer record exists to produce the filing.
- Cases where payroll records are incomplete and cannot be reconciled before the filing deadline.

## Required documents (must be provided by client)

The following documents cannot be produced by our service and must be provided by the client or employer:

- Employer Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN): original or copy × 1 — used to identify the employer in the BIR filing.
- Company / Employer details: business name, registered address, contact information.
- Payroll register or payroll summary for the tax year: copy × 1 — detailed breakdown of employee compensation, taxes withheld, benefits, and statutory deductions.
- Withholding tax certificates / return copies (e.g., BIR withholding returns) if already prepared: copies × as applicable.
- Employee personal details: full name, TIN (if available), tax identification information, and compensation breakdown per employee.
- Authorized representative documentation (if someone other than employer files): Special Power of Attorney or corporate authorization.

Notes: The employer must ensure payroll records are reconciled and final before submitting 2316 forms. Missing payroll reconciliation or missing withholding records will delay the filing and issuance of 2316 copies.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Preparation and internal reconciliation typically 1–5 business days depending on payroll complexity; submission should be completed before the statutory deadline (see Time Requirements).

### Step 1: Intake and payroll reconciliation

**Estimated duration:** 0.5–3 business days

Specific actions:
1. Employer supplies payroll registers, withholding computations, employee lists, and authorization for filing.
2. We review payroll for consistency, reconcile withholding amounts with monthly/quarterly returns, and flag missing or inconsistent items.
3. Confirm the final taxable compensation and total tax withheld for each employee.

**Required documents:** payroll register, withholding return copies, employee details, employer TIN.

**Notes:** Resolve any discrepancies with the payroll or accounting team before proceeding to prepare Form 2316.

### Step 2: Prepare Form 2316 and submission packet

**Estimated duration:** 0.5–2 business days

Specific actions:
1. Populate Form 2316 for each employee with reconciled figures and employer details.
2. Prepare a submission cover letter and manifest listing all employee forms included in the filing.
3. Obtain employer signature or authorized representative signature on required forms.

### Step 3: Submit to BIR and distribute copies to employees

**Estimated duration:** Same day to 2 business days depending on BIR channel

Specific actions:
1. Submit the filing packet to the BIR using the accepted channel (in-person or electronic) and obtain a filing receipt or acknowledgement when available.
2. Deliver employee copies of Form 2316 (printed or electronically secured PDF) to each employee.
3. Store filing evidence and deliver copies of receipts to employer records.

Possible issues and mitigations:

## Price & Fees

No fixed agent fee or official filing fee is recorded in the source evidence for this specific service. Official BIR processing rules and any government fees (if applicable) should be confirmed at intake. Employer service fees for preparation and submission will be quoted based on the number of employees and complexity of reconciliation.

**Price notes:**
- Agent handling fees (if charged) typically scale with employee count and reconciliation complexity.
- Official BIR charges (if any) are payable in addition to agent fees.

- Preparation recommendation: Begin reconciliation at least 2–3 weeks before the deadline to allow time for corrections and employee data collection.

## Important notes / Risks

- Late filing risk: Missing the February 28 deadline may trigger penalties or interest per BIR rules — confirm applicable penalty rules with BIR at time of filing.
