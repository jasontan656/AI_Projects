# Annual Report Filing

## Summary

Annual Report Filing is a document preparation and online submission service for corporate annual report obligations. Typical clients are companies that must prepare the annual report documents (for tax, regulatory or corporate record-keeping) and upload them through an official online portal. The service prepares required documents per the filing checklist, converts files to the required electronic format, uploads the materials, and schedules the final online submission. It also handles payment confirmation for the online filing when the payment channel is GCash.

## Background prerequisites

Clients must meet the following conditions to use this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The client or an authorised representative should be available in the Philippines if the filing requires local identity verification, original document presentation, or in-person payment collection. Remote preparation and electronic upload are supported for many portals, but some regulators require local verification.
- Relationship prerequisite: The requester must be an authorised corporate representative (company officer, corporate secretary, or authorised agent) with the legal authority to sign and submit corporate filings.
- Business prerequisite: The company must possess the source documents that feed the annual report (for example financial statements, board resolutions, reconciliation schedules). If an audited financial statement is required, that document must be prepared in advance (see Annual Financial Statement Preparation).

Not eligible:
- Entities without an authorised representative or lacking the underlying documents required for the annual report.

## Required documents

### Documents the client must provide (must be supplied by the company)

- Annual Report Documents (company-prepared reports and schedules):
  - Type: copy × required quantities as determined by the regulatory checklist
  - Requirements: Audited financial statement (if required by regulator), management report, board resolution approving the annual report (if required), any statutory schedules, and supporting attachments.
  - How used: The documents are compiled, converted to the required electronic formats (PDF, scanned attachments), and uploaded to the filing portal.

- Authorisation to submit:
  - Type: original or scanned board/shareholder/secretary authorisation or power of attorney
  - Requirements: Confirms the agent or officer has authority to submit on behalf of the company.

Notes: If the audited financial statement is missing, the client should obtain it through the Annual Financial Statement Preparation service before this filing can proceed.

### Documents the service can produce

- Electronic filing package (PDF / portal-ready files): prepared and validated copies of the annual report documents ready for upload.
- Upload confirmation and submission schedule: evidence of portal upload and planned submission timestamp.
- Internal submission checklist and delivery receipt for the client records.

## Documents obtained after completion

- Official filing confirmation (portal receipt or email acknowledgement): an electronic receipt showing the regulator accepted the submitted annual report package.
- Payment confirmation (if agent paid fees via GCash on client's behalf): scanned receipt or payment screenshot confirming the online filing fee was settled.

## Important notes

### Filing restrictions
- Some regulators require original documents to be presented at the time of submission; confirm whether the portal requires scanned copies only or original presentation.

### Timing and penalties
- File before the regulator's deadline to avoid penalties. Late filing can result in fines or additional compliance requirements.

### Payment and evidence
- If the client requests the agent to pay the portal fee using GCash, the client must confirm the payment and provide the payment reference immediately; the agent will attach payment evidence to the submission record.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Can you file remotely if I am outside the Philippines?
A: We can prepare the electronic filing package remotely. However, if the regulator requires original document presentation or a local identity check, a local authorised representative or an in-person visit may be necessary.

Q: What happens if the portal rejects uploaded files?
A: We validate files against the portal requirements before final submission. If the portal rejects a file, we correct formatting or missing metadata and re-upload until validation succeeds.
