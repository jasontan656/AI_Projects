# BIR Business Closure

## Summary

BIR Business Closure is the administrative process required to close a business record with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) that includes surrendering unused Official Receipts (OR) for destruction and locating the A.T.P. (Authority to Print) form used for printing receipts. Typical customers are small businesses or sole proprietors who are ceasing operations and need to regularize tax/receipt documentation. The service ensures that only unused OR receipts are surrendered for destruction, that the ATP form is provided to BIR for verification (the ATP may be borrowed and returned), and that a formal destruction acknowledgement is obtained from BIR for the client file. This task can be completed by the business owner or an authorised local representative.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions before the BIR Business Closure process can proceed:

- Geographic prerequisite: The process is normally handled in the Philippines. The business owner or an authorised local representative should be available to attend the BIR office or to hand over physical documents when required.
- Relationship prerequisite: The person submitting the closure request must be the business owner, authorised signatory, or a formally authorised representative with a signed authorization letter accepted by the BIR.
- Business prerequisite: The business must possess any unused Official Receipts that were printed and remain unused and must be able to present the ATP (Authority to Print) form or provide a clear statement about the document holder who has custody of the ATP form.

Not eligible:
- Businesses that cannot present evidence of their unused OR inventory or cannot produce an ATP form (either directly or through a traceable source) will face delays and may need additional document retrieval services.

## Required documents

### Documents the client must provide (cannot be produced by our service)

**Unused Official Receipts (OR)**
- Type: original × N
- Requirements: All unused official receipt books/leaflets that were printed for the business. The receipts should be unissued/unused and intact.
- How used: These originals must be surrendered to BIR for destruction. They are consumable: BIR will collect the unused ORs and will not return them to the client.

**Authority to Print (ATP) form**
- Type: original × 1 (if available)
- Requirements: The ATP form used by the printer or issuing authority (Authority to Print receipts). If the client does not hold the ATP, provide the name and contact of the printing supplier or the department that holds the ATP so the ATP can be located.
- How used: The ATP form is required by BIR as part of the closure package; operationally the ATP may be temporarily borrowed for verification and will be returned.

**Signed Authorization (if represented)**
- Type: original signed authorization × 1
- Requirements: If the business owner appoints an authorised representative to handle the surrender and closure, supply a signed authorization letter naming the representative and explicitly granting permission to surrender documents to BIR.
- How used: Presented to BIR to allow an authorised representative to submit and collect acknowledgement.

### Documents the service can prepare or produce

**BIR Submission Packet (prepared)**
- Producer: BIR Business Closure
- Path: BureauOfInternalRevenue/bir-business-closure.md
- Usage: A prepared cover letter, a checklist of surrendered receipts, and a submission packet tailored for the BIR closure counter.

## Documents issued after completion

**BIR Destruction Acknowledgement**
- Type: official acknowledgement (original or scanned copy) × 1
- Can be used for: proof that the unused OR receipts were surrendered and accepted by BIR for destruction; retained in the client's compliance file and used to demonstrate closure for accounting and tax purposes.
- Retention: Keep this acknowledgement permanently with the company records.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Usually same-day to a few business days depending on BIR queue and whether the ATP must be retrieved from a third party.

### Step 1: Inventory and prepare documents

**Estimated time:** 0.5–1 day

**Actions:**
1. Compile and count all unused OR receipt books and sheets; prepare an inventory listing the serial ranges and the total quantity of unused receipts.
2. Locate the ATP form (Authority to Print). If the ATP is not on file with the client, provide the printer's contact or trace the document source.
3. If using an authorised representative, prepare and sign the authorisation letter.

**Documents needed:** unused OR receipts, ATP information (or copy), authorization letter (if representing).

**Notes:** Ensure inventory accuracy — BIR will expect the surrendered receipts to match the submitted inventory.

---

### Step 2: Submit to BIR counter

**Estimated time:** 1–3 business days (depends on BIR queue)

**Actions:**
1. Present the inventory, the unused OR receipts, the ATP form (or proof of ATP location), and the signed authorization at the appropriate BIR office or closure counter.
2. Complete any BIR forms requested by the cashier or processing clerk for business closure and surrender of unused receipts.
3. BIR staff will physically receive the unused OR receipts and log them for destruction. The ATP form will be verified by the officer.

**Completion sign:** BIR accepts the surrendered receipts and schedules them for destruction; the officer provides a preliminary receipt or processing stub.

**Possible issues:**
- ATP missing → BIR may ask the client to obtain or confirm ATP details from the printer; the process will pause until the ATP is verified.
- Inventory mismatch → BIR will require reconciliation and may reject partial surrender until the inventory is corrected.

### Step 3: Obtain BIR destruction acknowledgement

**Estimated time:** same day to a few days

**Actions:**
1. When BIR completes the destruction intake, request the official destruction acknowledgement or receipt that documents the destruction order and the surrendered items.
2. Receive the BIR destruction acknowledgement and provide the client with the original; keep a scanned copy in the client compliance folder.

**Completion sign:** Receipt of an official BIR Destruction Acknowledgement confirming acceptance of the surrendered unused OR receipts and ATP verification.

## Price & Fees

No fixed agent fee or official BIR fee is recorded in the source evidence for this specific surrender process. BIR may not charge a separate fee for accepting unused receipt books for destruction; agent handling fees (if the client hires representation) are quoted at engagement. Confirm current local BIR practice at intake.

**Price notes:**
- If the ATP must be retrieved from a third-party printer, additional coordination fees may apply.
- If the client engages an authorised representative to perform the submission, expect a modest handling fee for document transfer and liaison.

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Submission restrictions
- Only unused Official Receipts (ORs) should be surrendered for destruction. Any receipts that have been issued, stamped, or used must not be surrendered as part of this process.

### ATP handling
- The ATP (Authority to Print) form is important for BIR verification. Operationally the ATP may be borrowed by BIR for inspection and will be returned; confirm recovery arrangements before submission.

### Timing
- Complete the inventory and ATP verification before attending BIR to avoid repeated visits. If the ATP is held by the printer, obtain a written confirmation from the printer of ATP custody to bring to BIR.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need to surrender used official receipts as well?**
No. Only unused Official Receipts that remain unissued should be surrendered for destruction. Used receipts must be kept as part of the accounting history and cannot be destroyed.

**Q: What happens to the ATP form?**
BIR uses the ATP (Authority to Print) to verify the printing authorization. BIR may borrow the ATP for verification and will normally return it. In practice the ATP is usually not retained permanently by BIR.

**Q: Can an authorised representative submit for me?**
Yes, provided you supply a signed authorization letter naming the representative. The representative should bring the authorization and the required identification when attending the BIR office.
