## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to request this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The authorized filer or their authorized representative must be able to submit to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) in the Philippines if an in-person filing is required by BIR channels. Remote submission may be possible only when BIR permits electronic filing or representative submission channels.
- Relationship prerequisite: The requester must be the taxpayer (company/partnership) or an authorized representative with valid authorization (corporate secretary resolution, special power of attorney, or equivalent) acceptable to BIR.
- Business prerequisite: The taxpayer must have an audited financial statement prepared by a licensed auditor when an audited FS is required by BIR for Form 1702RT filing. The audited financial statement must be finalized prior to submission.

Not eligible / cannot be handled under this task:
- Filings for taxpayers who do not require Form 1702RT (for example individuals using other forms).
- Cases where the audited financial statement is not available or not certified by a licensed auditor (these must be produced before filing).

## Required documents

### Documents the client must provide (cannot be produced by this service)

- Audited Financial Statement:
  - Type: original × 1
  - Requirement: A fully audited set of financial statements signed and stamped by a licensed external auditor. The audit opinion, balance sheet, income statement, and related notes must be included per BIR requirements.
  - How used: This document must be attached to the 1702RT on submission. According to the source evidence this original audited financial statement is collected by the BIR process and may be retained by the authority (the business should expect the document to be taken and not returned by the filing process if BIR procedure requires retention).
  - Consumable attribute: consumable (BIR may retain as part of their review) — the service treats it as "collected and not returned" unless BIR returns it afterwards.

- Company identification and authorization documents (copies and/or originals as required):
  - Examples: Certified Secretary's Certificate, Special Power of Attorney for representative, company TIN, valid IDs of authorized signatories.
  - Use: Validate authority to file on behalf of the taxpayer.

- Supporting tax schedules and reconciliations as required by the 1702RT form and by the audited financial statements (copies):
  - Examples: schedule of related-party transactions, tax computation worksheets, withholding tax certificates, and others required by law.
