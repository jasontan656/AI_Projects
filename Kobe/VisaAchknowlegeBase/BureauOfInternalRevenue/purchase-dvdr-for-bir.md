# Purchase DVD-R Blank Discs for BIR Submissions

## Summary

This standalone service helps clients procure suitable DVD-R blank optical media (DVD-R discs) required for Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) digital submissions or archival evidence transfer. Some BIR processes or third-party workflows accept or require physical media (CD/DVD) containing scanned tax forms or supporting evidence. This task covers specification, procurement, quality checks, and optional labelling and secure delivery of DVD-R media that meet BIR or vendor expectations.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions before we can fulfill a DVD-R procurement request:

- Geographic prerequisite: Procurement and physical delivery are local tasks in the Philippines. Clients should confirm whether they want delivery to an office address in the Philippines or pickup at a specified location. Remote orders can be processed but require a local delivery address.
- Relationship prerequisite: None specific beyond being a staff member or authorised representative for the company or tax agent ordering the media.
- Business prerequisite: Confirm the receiving office (BIR office or third-party vendor) will accept DVD-R discs and whether any specific media format, labelling, or file-system (ISO9660/UDF), file naming convention, or checksum requirement is mandated for submission.

Not eligible:
- Requests without a clear delivery address or without confirmation that the recipient accepts DVD-R media.

## What we provide

- Specification guidance: recommend appropriate media type (DVD-R, single-layer), brand quality guidance, capacity (4.7 GB), and burn format recommendations (ISO9660 or UDF depending on receiving system).
- Procurement: source and purchase blank DVD-R discs in the required quantity and deliver to the client or shipping address.
- Optional services: label printing, ISO image creation from client-provided files, MD5/SHA256 checksum generation for the burned data, and secure sealed packaging.
- Compliance checks: verify physical disc integrity, test-burn sample disc, and confirm readability on standard Windows and macOS systems.

---

## Use cases

- Submitting scanned tax filings, supporting schedules, or archived backup media to BIR or a partnering processing house.
- Providing an official submission archive to auditors or government counters that prefer physical media for record-keeping.
- Creating a long-term physical backup of scanned tax records in addition to electronic submission.

---

## Recommended DVD-R specification

- Type: DVD-R (single-write), 4.7GB capacity.
- Media brand: choose reputable brands (e.g., Verbatim, TDK, Sony) with high-rated burn reliability.
- Burning mode: use finalized ISO9660 or UDF filesystem depending on the receiving system. Prioritize ISO9660 for compatibility unless the recipient requests UDF.
- File naming convention: avoid non-ASCII characters; use uppercase for extension (.PDF) and include a manifest.txt with a short index and checksums.
- Checksums: provide MD5 or SHA256 for each file and for the final ISO image.

## Ordering workflow (typical)

1. Intake and specification (same day): we confirm quantity, delivery location, labelling preference, and whether you need files burned onto the discs or just blank media delivered.
2. Procurement and quality sampling (1–3 business days): we source the media from a verified vendor, perform sample burns to validate playback/readability, and prepare discs for your order.
3. Optional data burning and verification (1–2 business days extra): if you provide files, we create ISO images, burn discs, and produce a manifest with checksums for each disc.
4. Delivery or pickup (same day as burn completion or per schedule): deliver sealed discs via secure courier or arrange in-office pickup. Provide digital evidence (scan of the disc label, manifest, and checksum files).

**Documents required from client:**
- Delivery address and contact person
- If data burning required: the final fileset in a secure transfer (SFTP, secure cloud link) and instructions about filesystem and naming conventions

## Pricing guidance

- Blank DVD-R media (example): PHP 8–20 per disc depending on brand and quantity (bulk discounts apply for larger quantity orders).
- Burn and checksum service (optional): PHP 150–500 per disc depending on the number of files and verification requested.
- Label printing (optional): PHP 10–50 per disc for printed adhesive labels or silk-screen style labels depending on volume.
- Secure courier delivery: variable by distance (quoted at time of order).

Final quote provided at intake based on quantity, optional data burning, labeling and delivery preferences.

## Risks and recommendations

- Always confirm the receiving party will accept DVD-R media; many modern agencies prefer secure e-delivery (FTP, SFTP, or portal upload).
- Keep a digital backup of all files before burning — DVD-R is write-once and cannot be modified.
- Provide a manifest and checksums to the recipient to speed verification and acceptance.
