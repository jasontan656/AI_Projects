# BIR Related Administrative Support (General Assistance)

## Summary

This service provides flexible, short-term administrative support for tasks related to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). It is intended for clients who require a general agent to assist with low‑complexity, operational BIR activities such as delivering physical or digital submission media, coordinating payments, confirming receipt of filings, couriering documents to BIR counters, and performing light follow-up on routine requests. The service is purposely broad and designed to complement existing specialized BIR services (for example 1702RT Filing or Annual Report Filing) where ad-hoc tasks arise that do not warrant a full case engagement.

---

## Who needs this service

- Small businesses or tax agents who occasionally require local representation for routine BIR interactions (document drop-off, receipt collection, small payments, courier delivery).
- Clients who need secure handling of physical evidence for BIR filing: pickup, packing, and sealed delivery of submission media (CD/DVD) or printed forms.
- Individuals who need short, focused assistance for non-complex BIR tasks and prefer to outsource the logistics to a local operator.

---

## Typical scope of work

- Collect physical documents or media from clients, verify identity and sign submission cover letters.
- Submit forms or supporting materials to designated BIR counters and secure the official stamped receipt or claim stub.
- Pay routine BIR fees at approved bank channels and deliver validated payment proof to the client and to the submitting party.
- Coordinate secure courier delivery of BIR acknowledged documents to recipients (auditors, accountants, or remote stakeholders).
- Provide simple follow-up: confirm whether BIR has accepted the package and record any immediate requests for additional materials.

This service does not provide legal advice, does not complete complex appeals, and does not substitute for the dedicated tax or legal representation required for contested matters.

## Background prerequisites

- Geographic prerequisite: This is an in‑country, Philippines-focused operational service. The agent operates locally and can attend BIR counters (windows) and banks as required.
- Relationship prerequisite: The client must be the document owner, an authorised representative, or an employer who signs an authorisation letter permitting the agent to act on their behalf for specific tasks.
- Business prerequisite: Clients must supply original documents or secure digital links to the submission materials. For payment tasks, funds must be available or a deposit must be provided in advance.

Not eligible:
- Complex dispute resolution, legal appeals, or tasks that require formal legal counsel (refer to ALO Lifting, Tax Appeals or legal services).

## Process / Typical steps

1. Intake & brief: client supplies the documents or digital files and authorises the agent to proceed. The agent logs the submission details and confirms the fee or deposit.
2. Pre-submission check: agent performs a basic document completeness check and prepares the submission packet or courier manifest.
3. Submission & payment: agent submits documents at BIR counter, pays routine filing fees at the bank (if requested), and obtains official receipts.
4. Confirmation & evidence: agent scans the stamped receipt and the stamped forms (or takes a photographed receipt where allowed) and returns the scanned evidence to the client.
5. Short follow-up: agent monitors any short-term feedback from the BIR counter for missing attachments and relays instructions to the client.

## Pricing & typical fees

- Fee structure: charged per task or hourly, depending on the requested scope (for example a single document drop-off and receipt collection vs multi-bank payment coordination across several locations).
- Example costs: small one-off courier + submission tasks are typically quoted as a fixed small fee; complex multi-bank payment batches or multi-office collections will be quoted case-by-case.

Detailed quote will be provided at intake based on distance, number of counters to visit, payment amounts and whether secure courier return of originals is requested.

  reason: "This general support service complements the structured BIR Filings service: we can perform ad-hoc deliveries, obtain stamped receipts, and attach them to the formal filing package."

- name: "1702RT Filing"
  path: "BureauOfInternalRevenue/1702rt-filing.md"
  reason: "When a formal tax return filing needs ad-hoc logistical support (for example delivering an audited financial statement on DVD-R or returning BIR-stamped originals), this operational support service performs those tasks."

## Evidence & source notes

> The following lines come from the original chat evidence that prompted this lightweight operational service entry:

**Message 390720** (2023-02-27): "需要购买DVD-R空白光盘用于BIR" — client requested purchasing DVD-R blanks for BIR submissions.

**Message 393663** (2023-03-01): "处理BIR相关事务" — a short reference to handling BIR-related matters.

These messages formed a compact operational request: procurement of blank optical media and handling BIR tasks. This new general support service allows such ad-hoc operational work to be ordered as a short engagement.

## How to engage

Provide a short instruction email with:
- A brief description of the task (document drop-off, payment, courier, DVD procurement and burn)
- The delivery address and contact person
- Whether you want data burning or just blank media delivered
- Any preferred time windows for in‑office submissions

We will respond with a written quote and estimated turnaround within one business day.
