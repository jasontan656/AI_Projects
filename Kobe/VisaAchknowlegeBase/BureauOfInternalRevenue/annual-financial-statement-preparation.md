# Annual Financial Statement Preparation

## Summary

Annual Financial Statement Preparation (AFS Preparation) is a standalone advisory and drafting service to compile and prepare the company's annual financial statements (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow, Notes) for a specified tax year (for example 2023). Typical clients are small businesses, sole proprietors, or companies that require a clear, audit-ready draft AFS to support BIR filings (for example Form 1702RT), bank compliance, or management review. The service reviews accounting records, categorizes income and expenses for correct tax reporting, produces a formatted AFS draft, and provides a short advisory on tax filing linkage and any missing supporting evidence.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions before we can perform AFS Preparation:

- Geographic prerequisite: The client can be remote for document upload and advisory, but physical access to original receipts or documents may be required if authoritative originals are needed for audit or BIR review. Remote handling is supported if scanned copies are acceptable.
- Relationship prerequisite: The requester should be the company owner, chief financial officer, or an authorised representative with access to financial records and bank statements.
- Business prerequisite: The client must have accounting records for the year to be reported (e.g., bookkeeping ledger, bank statements, sales invoices, expense receipts). The service does not create transactional records from scratch; it prepares the AFS based on client-supplied source documents or accounting exports.

Not eligible:
- Businesses with no available accounting records for the reporting year. In such cases, reconstructive bookkeeping is a separate service and must be arranged first.

## Required documents

### Documents the client must provide (cannot be produced by this service)

Provide the following items unless otherwise agreed in writing:

- Bank statements (all corporate accounts) for the year:
  - Type: scanned copies or accounting exports
  - Quantity: full-year statements for each account
  - Requirement: electronic copies that clearly show dates, transaction descriptions, and balances

- Sales invoices / revenue evidence:
  - Type: digital copies or accounting sales ledger
  - Requirement: supporting documents that substantiate reported revenue

- Expense receipts and invoices:
  - Type: scanned receipts / supplier invoices
  - Requirement: all business-related expenses the client wishes to record

- Payroll summary and withholding records (if applicable):
  - Type: payroll register and tax remittance receipts
  - Requirement: used to prepare payroll and employer-related note disclosures

- Previous year financial statements or opening balances (if available):
  - Type: PDF or accounting export
  - Use: to establish opening equity and comparative disclosures

Notes: Originals remain the client’s property. We will request originals only where strictly necessary for verification; ordinarily scanned copies are sufficient for drafting the AFS.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Typically 3–10 business days depending on document completeness and case complexity.

### Step 1: Intake and document collection

**Estimated duration:** 0.5–2 business days

Specific actions:
1. Client provides scanned bank statements, sales and expense documentation, payroll summaries and prior AFS (if available).
2. Project manager performs a document completeness check and returns a short checklist indicating missing items.
3. Client supplies any missing items or authorises the agent to proceed with available records (note: incomplete source data may generate qualifications in the draft AFS).

**Needed documents:** bank statements, sales invoices, expense receipts, payroll summary

**Note:** The intake includes a brief client interview to confirm accounting method (cash/accrual), currency used, and any unusual transactions.


### Step 2: Review, categorize and reconcile

**Estimated duration:** 1–5 business days

Specific actions:
1. Reconcile bank statements to the accounting ledger and identify unmatched items.
2. Review and categorize income and expense transactions according to accounting standards and tax requirements.
3. Prepare working schedules: trial balance, revenue schedule, cost and expense roll-ups, and adjustments for accruals, depreciation, and other standard year-end entries.

**Completion sign:** Trial balance reconciled and working papers prepared for AFS drafting.


### Step 3: Prepare AFS draft and advisory

**Estimated duration:** 1–3 business days

Specific actions:
1. Draft the Annual Financial Statements (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow, Notes) using reconciled trial balance and supporting schedules.
2. Prepare a short advisory memo highlighting key items affecting tax filings (non-deductible expenses, related-party transactions, documented evidence gaps) and recommended corrective actions.
3. Submit the draft AFS and schedules to the client for review.

**Completion sign:** Client reviews and approves the draft or requests revisions; after finalisation the AFS is ready to be attached to BIR filings.

## Price & Fees

No fixed public retail price is recorded in the source Telegram evidence. Typical price components and examples:

- Professional drafting and review fee (example rate): negotiated per engagement depending on volume of transactions and complexity
- Additional fees: on-site verification, retrieval of originals, or liaising with external auditor are charged separately

**Price notes:** Confirm a case-specific quote at intake. For BIR filing support (for example 1702RT) coordinate with the tax-filing service to avoid double-counting work.


---

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Preparation limitations
- The AFS is prepared from client-supplied records. Where records are incomplete or inconsistent the AFS will include explanatory notes and may carry qualifications that could affect BIR filing or audit reliance.

### Timing considerations
- Some BIR deadlines (for example 1702RT attachments) are fixed; clients should plan to supply source documentation well ahead of filing deadlines to avoid rushed or qualified outputs.

### Risk warnings
- Material omissions in source documents may affect reported taxable income and result in BIR assessment risk. We advise clients to keep originals for at least the statutory retention period and to be prepared to produce them on request.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: What period does the AFS cover?
A: The AFS covers the fiscal year specified at intake (for example calendar year 2023). Ensure that all transactions for that period are provided.

Q: Can you prepare an audited financial statement?
A: This service produces a draft AFS. If an audited statement is required, coordinate with a licensed auditor — our AFS draft can be provided to the auditor as the working paper.

Q: Do you file taxes for me after AFS preparation?
A: AFS preparation is a distinct service. Tax filing (for example Form 1702RT) is a separate service that uses the prepared AFS as an input.
