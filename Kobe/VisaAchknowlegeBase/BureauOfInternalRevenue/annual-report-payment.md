# Annual Report Payment

## Summary

Annual Report Payment handles the payment step required to complete a corporate annual report submission for a specific client case (example: YIN QI). This standalone service records payment collection, produces a verification receipt for the corporate filing package, and confirms payment evidence for the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) or other filing channels. Typical users are company officers, authorised representatives (corporate secretaries, accountants), or agents who need to provide official proof of payment to complete their Annual Report Filing.


## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions before this payment service can proceed:

- Geographic prerequisite: Payments can be done remotely via bank transfer / e-payment where the filing channel accepts them. For cash or in-person payments the payer or an authorised representative must be physically present in the Philippines.
- Relationship prerequisite: The payer should be the company representative (authorized signatory), accountant, or an authorised agent with written permission to make payments on the company's behalf.
- Business prerequisite: The Annual Report Filing package must be prepared or in-progress; the payment service requires a filing reference or instruction to allocate the payment correctly to the annual report submission.

Not eligible:
- Anonymous payments or payments without an assigned filing reference. The agent will not accept payments that cannot be reconciled to a specific filing.


## Required documents and information (client must provide)

The following items must be provided by the client and cannot be produced by this service:

- Company name and filing reference
  - Type: information
  - Requirement: The official company name and any filing reference (for example portal reference or invoice code) so the payment can be allocated to the correct Annual Report submission.

- Proof of payment method
  - Type: bank transfer screenshot, deposit slip photo, or e-payment confirmation
  - Requirement: Clear evidence showing amount, date/time, transaction reference, payer name and beneficiary account.
  - How used: Used to generate the payment confirmation attached to the annual report package.

- Authorisation (if a third party pays)
  - Type: signed authorisation letter or email confirmation
  - Requirement: If someone other than the authorised signatory is paying (for example an agent or accountant), provide written authorisation to accept and reconcile the payment.


## Service outputs

Upon completion the client receives:

- Payment Confirmation PDF
  - Type: digital receipt produced by the agent that consolidates the raw payment evidence and links it to the filing reference.
  - Use: Attach to the Annual Report Filing package (BIR or other portal) as proof of payment.

- Reconciliation note (case file entry)
  - Type: internal case note (agent-produced)
  - Use: Records who paid, when, how much, and which filing the payment was allocated to.

## Price & Fees

| Effective Date | Currency | Amount | Applicable Conditions | Notes | Evidence |
|---------------:|:--------:|-------:|---------------------:|------|---------:|
| 2024-01 | PHP | 500 | Annual report fee for YIN QI (case evidence) | Example case: cash payment for YIN QI annual report. Agent handling fees for payment processing may be additional and quoted at intake. | message 502453 |

**Notes:**
- The PHP 500 entry is a recorded case-specific payment extracted from chat evidence (see Evidence Sources). It represents the government or filing fee paid in that instance. Agent administrative/handling fees for managing payments, issuing confirmations or couriering receipts are separate and will be quoted at intake.


## Attention & Special Conditions

- Always include the filing reference in the payment reference field so the receiving office or agent can reconcile the payment to the correct submission. Payments without a correct reference risk processing delays.
- For cross-border payments, confirm beneficiary account currency and instruct the payer who bears intermediary bank charges; the recipient should receive the exact amount required by the filing channel.
- Agents will not proceed to attach a payment confirmation to a filing until verification completes and the payment is reconciled.
