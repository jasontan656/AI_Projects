# Audition and Shooting

## Summary

Audition and Shooting is a short operational service that arranges and coordinates paid casting auditions and scheduled filming/shooting sessions for video production and post-production tasks. Typical customers are production teams, talent agencies, and participants who need a structured audition process and subsequent shooting days. The service handles participant intake, identity verification, scheduling, on-site coordination for acting and editing tasks during the audition, and logistics for follow-up shooting sessions. The audition day is a paid participation day and applicants must present their original government ID for identity verification.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Depends on schedule; the core audition session is typically a single day event (several hours) and any follow-up shooting days are scheduled based on production needs.

### Step 1: Registration and intake

**Estimated duration:** 10–30 minutes (pre-event)

**Specific actions:**
1. Participant registers for the audition slot via the production team's notice or booking link.
2. Provide required contact information and a scan or photo of a government ID in advance if requested.
3. Receive audition time slot, location details and any brief performance requirements.

**Required documents:**
- Government ID (copy or original as requested)

**Notes:**
- Late arrivals may be rescheduled to a later audition or refused depending on slot availability.

### Step 2: Attend the audition (on scheduled date)

**Estimated duration:** 1–4 hours depending on audition format and number of participants.

**Specific actions:**
1. Participant arrives at the venue at the scheduled time.
2. Present original government ID for identity verification at check-in.
3. Receive audition instructions and perform the requested material (acting lines, improvisation, or on-camera test) and participate in directed editing tasks if required by the casting brief.
4. Production captures footage and records notes on performance. If the audition day is paid, organisers will process the participation payment according to the previously agreed terms.

**Required documents:**
- Original government ID (for check-in)

**Completion sign:** Participant completes audition session and signs any participation forms or receipts.

### Step 3: Post-audition evaluation and selection

**Estimated duration:** 1–7 days depending on evaluation process

**Specific actions:**
1. Producers and directors review footage and evaluation sheets.
2. Selected participants are offered shooting dates and provided call sheets and consent/release forms as needed.
3. Unselected participants receive a courtesy notification by email or message.

**Completion sign:** Selected participants receive a production call sheet and confirmation of next steps.

### Step 4: Follow-up shooting and production coordination

**Estimated duration:** Variable — depends on production schedules

**Specific actions:**
1. Confirm participant availability and collect any additional required materials (wardrobe, additional releases).
2. Conduct the shooting session(s) per call sheet and production plan.
3. Deliver final edited footage or coordinate further post-production as part of the contracted deliverables.

**Possible issues and mitigations:**
- Issue: Participant fails to attend scheduled shoot → Mitigation: Maintain backup list of stand-by talent and include cancellation policy in call sheet.
- Issue: ID not acceptable at check-in → Mitigation: Verify acceptable ID list at registration and advise participants to bring an alternate accepted government ID.
