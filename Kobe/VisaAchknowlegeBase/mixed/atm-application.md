# ATM Application

## Summary

An ATM Application is the process by which a bank customer requests a new ATM (cash) card linked to a bank account. Typical users are bank account holders who need a physical debit/ATM card for ATM withdrawals, point-of-sale transactions, or card-based banking services. The service requires valid identification documents presented to a bank branch (examples: NBI clearance or PhilHealth ID, depending on the bank's ID policy) and the account holder's signature on bank forms. This task helps customers understand which IDs a bank may accept, how to prepare for an in-branch application, and the basic steps the bank will follow to issue or replace an ATM card.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to apply for an ATM card:

- Geographic prerequisite: The applicant should be available to attend the bank branch in person if the bank requires physical presence for identity verification and card issuance.
- Relationship prerequisite: The applicant must be the bank account holder or an authorised signatory for the account (the bank will verify account ownership).
- Business prerequisite: The account must be active and in good standing according to the bank's internal rules (for example minimum balance, required KYC documents already on file).

Not eligible:
- Persons who are not account holders and lack valid authorisation to obtain a card for the account.
- Applicants who cannot provide acceptable identity documents as required by the bank's KYC policy.

## Required documents

### Documents the client must provide (must be supplied by the client)

- NBI Clearance
  - Type: original × 1
  - Mandatory: Yes (depending on bank policy)
  - Requirements: Original NBI clearance that is valid per the bank's acceptance rules. Banks sometimes accept NBI clearance as a government-issued identification for first-time card issuance. The original will be borrowed for verification and returned after processing.
  - How used: Primary identity document for KYC verification when the bank accepts NBI as ID.

- PhilHealth ID
  - Type: original × 1
  - Mandatory: No (optional alternative)
  - Requirements: Original PhilHealth ID as an alternative government-issued identification document if the bank accepts it. The original will be borrowed for verification and returned after processing.
  - How used: Secondary identity option if the bank policy permits.

Notes: Banks differ in which IDs they accept; confirm the bank's accepted ID list before visiting. Originals are typically shown and may be temporarily held by the bank for processing and returned upon completion.

- ATM Card Issuance Receipt
  - Type: official receipt / copy
  - Producer: ATM Application (bank)

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Varies by bank (same day for instant-issue products, or several days for ordering and printing). Expect 1–7 business days in most cases.

### Step 1: Prepare identity documents and bank account information

**Estimated duration:** 10–30 minutes

Specific actions:
1. Gather required identification documents such as an original NBI clearance or PhilHealth ID (or other bank-accepted ID).
2. Bring your bank account information (account number, valid ID on file) and any existing bank reference or passbook if applicable.

**Needed documents:**
- NBI Clearance (original) or PhilHealth ID (original)

**Notes:**
- Confirm the bank's accepted ID list before visiting to avoid delay.

### Step 2: Visit the bank branch and request an ATM card

**Estimated duration:** 30 minutes to a few hours (depends on queue and bank procedures)

Specific actions:
1. Go to your bank branch and request ATM card issuance or replacement at the customer service counter.
2. Present the required identity documents and your account details. The bank staff will verify your identity and account eligibility.
3. Complete any bank forms required (card application, signature card). Pay any applicable issuance or delivery fees if charged by the bank.

**Completion sign:** Bank provides an issuance receipt or a collection date for the card.

### Step 3: Receive and activate the card

**Estimated duration:** Same day (if instant-issue) to several days (if mail or branch collection required)

Specific actions:
1. When the card is available, collect it at the branch or receive it by courier according to the bank's procedure.
2. Follow the bank's activation instructions (for example: call bank hotline, use an ATM to set PIN, online activation) before first use.

**Notes:**
- If the bank produces the card on site, you may be able to activate and use it immediately.
- If the card is mailed, keep the courier tracking details and expect ID verification on delivery in some cases.

## Price & Conditions

No fixed retail price was captured in the source evidence. Banks may charge an issuance fee or a replacement fee for lost/damaged cards. Confirm current bank fees at the branch or on the bank's official price list. The source chat evidence did not provide a concrete fee for ATM issuance.

**Price notes:**
- Issuance and delivery fees vary by bank and product.
- Activation is typically free; transaction fees depend on usage (ATM withdrawals, POS transactions, foreign transaction fees).

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Processing limitations
- The bank decides which identification documents are acceptable for ATM card issuance. Some banks require national ID cards or passports; others may accept alternative documents like NBI clearance as part of their KYC process.

### Time requirements
- Bring originals to the bank and expect identity verification; if you must provide additional documentation the bank requests, this can delay issuance.

### Risk & privacy
- Do not share your PIN or sign the card acceptance slip until you confirm the card details are correct. Keep card PIN confidential.
