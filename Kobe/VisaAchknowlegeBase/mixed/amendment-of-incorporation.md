# Amendment of Incorporation

## Summary

An Amendment of Incorporation is the formal legal filing made to the corporate registry to change the corporation's articles of incorporation or registered corporate details. Typical reasons include changes in corporate purpose, increase or decrease of authorized capital, change in principal office address, change in the number of stockholders, or other corporate structural matters. Clients who need to modify the company constitution or official registry entries must file an amendment with the appropriate national corporate regulator. In the Philippines, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is the primary regulator for corporate filings and the SEC main office is located in Makati City.

## When this service is needed

- When the company changes its corporate purpose or principal business activities.
- When the company changes its registered office address.
- When the authorized capital stock or the number/class of shares must be changed.
- When directors or officers positions require formal amendment of the articles (subject to local law restrictions).
- When the number of stockholders is updated (note: some foundational incorporators information may be immutable depending on the jurisdiction and the specific legal instrument).

Not all corporate fields may be amendable by an Articles amendment. Certain historical incorporator facts or foundational incorporator designations may be restricted by local corporate law and cannot be altered after incorporation; confirm specific limitations at intake.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet these preconditions before we can file an Amendment of Incorporation:

- Geographic prerequisite: The corporation or its authorized representative must submit filings according to the local corporate registry rules. Some steps may be handled remotely by an authorised corporate representative, but the physical presence requirement depends on the registry's representation rules.
- Relationship prerequisite: The requestor must be an authorised representative of the corporation (for example corporate secretary, company director, or a person with a valid board resolution authorising the filing) or the company officers who have the legal authority to sign corporate resolutions.
- Business prerequisite: The corporation must have the corporate documents required to support the requested amendment (for example board resolution, shareholders resolution, notarised documents, proof of publication if the law requires public notice).

Not eligible:
- Unauthorised third parties without corporate authorization.
- Requests that involve changes prohibited by national corporate law or changes that would require judicial approval rather than administrative amendment.

## Required documents

### Documents the client must provide (must be supplied by the company)

These are documents that cannot be produced by our office and must be provided by the client before an amendment filing.

1) Corporate Board Resolution / Shareholders Resolution
- Type: original / certified copy × 1
- Requirement: Duly adopted resolution by the board of directors and, if required by statute, a shareholders resolution approving the specific amendment. Must be signed by authorised signatories and notarised where required by law.
- How used: The registry requires corporate authority evidence for the amendment; the resolution explains the precise amendment and authorises filing.

2) Company's Current Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws
- Type: copy / original as required × 1
- Requirement: The currently filed articles and by-laws to be compared with the proposed amendment text.
- How used: Used to prepare the marked-up amendment and to confirm existing corporate details.

3) Supporting Evidence (depending on amendment type)
- Examples: proof of new principal office address (lease or utility), updated capital structure documentation, deed of sale or proof of share transfer when stock ownership changes occur.
- If the amendment involves share transfers, provide the Deed of Sale or Proof of Stock Sale.
- If the transaction is between shareholders, provide any internal agreements or transfer instruments.

Notes: Originals may be required for certain registry processes and will be returned after completion unless the registry retains them for official archival reasons.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Variable depending on the registry queue, the amendment complexity and whether public notices are required. Typical processing: 1–4 weeks for straightforward amendments; more complex capital or ownership changes may require longer compliance steps.

### Step 1 — Intake and corporate authority capture

**Estimated duration:** 1–3 business days

Specific actions:
1. Client provides copies or originals of board/shareholder resolutions and the current Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws.
2. Agent reviews the requested amendment and confirms whether the change is allowed by corporate law and whether additional approvals (for example shareholder consent) are required.
3. Prepare an engagement letter and price estimate for the amendment filing.

**Required documents:** Board resolution, shareholders resolution (if required), current articles.

**Notes:** If the amendment includes a share sale or transfer, request the Deed of Sale / Proof of Stock Sale from the client; this may be optional in some jurisdictions but often required as documentary support.

### Step 2 — Drafting the Amendment

**Estimated duration:** 1–5 business days (depends on complexity)

Specific actions:
1. Draft the proposed amendment text in the registry's required statutory format (marked-up version and final clean copy).
2. Send the draft to the authorised corporate signatory for review and to obtain the required signatures and notarisation if needed.
3. Prepare any statutory forms required by the corporate registry and a full submission checklist.

**Completion sign:** Signed amendment text and supporting documents are ready for submission.

### Step 3 — Lodge with the Corporate Registry (SEC or equivalent)

**Estimated duration:** Same-day submission; processing depends on registry workload (days to weeks)

Specific actions:
1. Submit the amendment packet to the corporate registry in Makati (SEC headquarters) or the appropriate national office according to the registry's procedures.
2. Pay the official registry filing fees and any publication fees (if publication in a newspaper is required by statute for certain amendments).
3. Monitor the registry processing and respond to any clarifications the registry requests.

**Completion sign:** The registry issues official receipt and later a certified copy acknowledging the recorded amendment.

### Step 4 — Post-filing updates

**Estimated duration:** 1–5 business days after registry outputs are received

Specific actions:
1. Deliver the certified copy and updated corporate documents to the client.
2. Advise the client on any downstream updates required (for example tax authority, bank account changes, licensing agencies) and offer additional services to update those records.

**Possible issues:**
- Registry may request additional documentation or notarisation corrections → agent resolves by obtaining the missing documents and re-submitting.
- Some registries require public notice publication for certain amendments (for example capital or share structure) → agent coordinates publication and proof-of-publication.

## Price & Fees

No single universal fee is recorded; official registry fees and publication fees vary by amendment type and jurisdiction. The agent's handling fee will depend on the amendment complexity, whether notarisation and publication are required, and whether additional corporate documents must be produced.

**Price notes:**
- Expect additional costs if the amendment requires: certified publication, notarisation of multiple documents, or retrieval of historical corporate records.
- Agent will provide an itemised quote at intake.

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Legal limitations
- Certain foundational incorporator details may be legally immutable in some jurisdictions. Evidence extracted from the client's chat states that "original incorporators cannot be amended" in that jurisdiction. Verify the specific legal limits before promising a change.

### Practical considerations
- SEC headquarters is located in Makati (per extracted evidence). Clients should expect in-person steps or formal authorisations to enable agent submission.
- If the amendment involves share transfer documentation (for example sale of shares), provide Deed of Sale or Proof of Stock Sale as evidentiary support — this may be optional in some cases but advisable.

### Risks
- Non-compliant amendment language or missing approvals will cause the registry to return or reject the filing; ensure board and shareholder approvals are properly documented and valid.
- Publication requirements (if any) may extend the effective date of the amendment and add to cost.
