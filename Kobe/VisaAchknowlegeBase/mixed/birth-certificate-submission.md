# Birth Certificate Submission

## Summary

This service receives certified birth certificate copies (or photocopies) from clients and submits them to third-party processors for purposes such as marriage contracting, dependent inclusion, or related administrative filings. Typical users are clients who already hold the certified birth record and only require our team to deliver clear scanned or physical copies to the processing party (for example an attorney, registry office, or marriage contract processor). This task is a short standalone service: collect, verify, transmit and confirm return of originals when required.

---

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions before we can accept a Birth Certificate Submission request:

- Geographic prerequisite: The client may be remote for digital submissions (scans) but must be able to make originals available locally if the processor requires physical documents for certification or further action.
- Relationship prerequisite: The requester should be the record owner (the person named on the birth certificate), a parent/guardian, or an authorised representative with a signed authorisation when the owner is unavailable.
- Business prerequisite: The required birth certificates must already exist (certified by the issuing civil authority). This task does not procure or re-issue official certified copies — it only accepts and forwards copies or originals to a processing partner.

Not eligible:
- Requests where no certified birth certificate is available and the client asks us to obtain one from the civil registry (use "Birth Certificate Request" service instead).
- Requests that require legalisation/apostille unless specifically instructed and quoted (those are separate services).

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Same day to a few business days depending on delivery method and the processor's receipt confirmation.

### Step 1 — Intake and verification

**Estimated time:** Same day (hours)
1. Client provides clear scans of the certified birth certificates or delivers originals to our office if physical delivery is required.
2. We verify the scans for legibility and confirm that required fields (full name, date of birth, civil registry stamp) are present.
3. If the processor requires original documents, confirm the delivery appointment and document custody expectations with the client.

**Required for this step:** scanned PDFs or originals, authorisation if represented.

**Notes:** Do not submit low-quality scans. We will ask the client for new images if the scans are not clear.

---

### Step 2 — Prepare submission packet

**Estimated time:** 1–2 hours
1. Convert the supplied documents into high-quality PDF/A format if requested.
2. Create a short cover note that explains the purpose of submission (for example: "Submission of certified birth certificates for marriage contract processing for RonaLyn Bucad Silva and Grace Dechos Rivera").
3. Attach any supporting ID or authorisation documents required by the receiving party.

**Deliverables:** digital packet (PDF) and a printed envelope manifest if couriering originals.

---

### Step 3 — Transmit documents to processor

**Estimated time:** minutes to 1 business day depending on method
1. Send the digital packet via WeChat (preferred by the processor in this case), email, or secure upload. If processor accepts physical originals, deliver via secure courier or in-person handover.
2. Record the transmission timestamp and the contact details of the receiving officer.
3. Request confirmation of receipt from the processor and keep the confirmation in the case file.

**Notes:** In this practice the processor prefers WeChat transmissions for initial processing.

---

### Step 4 — Follow-up and return of originals

**Estimated time:** 1–5 business days depending on processor policy
1. Monitor the processor's handling and request a written confirmation once processing is complete.
2. If originals were delivered and the processor's policy is to return them, collect and return originals to the client promptly. If the processor retains originals per their rules, obtain an official custody receipt for the client.
3. Close the case once the client confirms receipt of processed outputs or collected originals.

**Key output:** receipt of confirmation and return of originals where applicable.

## Price & Fees

- This service is typically charged as a small handling fee plus any courier delivery costs. No standard fee is fixed here: confirm the handling and courier quote at intake. Official processing fees charged by the receiving party (if any) are not included and must be paid by the client if requested.

**Price notes:** No government fee applies to the act of submission itself. Courier or local handover fees apply where originals are physically delivered.

---

## Important notes and risks

- Ensure that the certified birth certificate is the correct type required by the receiving processor (PSA, civil registry certified copy, etc.). Wrong document types cause delays.
- Always request and retain a written acknowledgement of receipt from the processor. If originals are surrendered, obtain a signed custody receipt.
- Protect privacy: do not share identity documents in open channels. Use the agreed secure WeChat contact or secure upload portal.
