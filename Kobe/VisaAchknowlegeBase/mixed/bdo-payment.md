# BDO Payment

## Summary

BDO Payment is a small in-branch cash payment task conducted at a Bank of the Philippine Islands (BDO) branch. Typical users are individuals or agents who must make a small, immediate cash payment in person to a specified recipient at a BDO counter. The example case in the evidence involved a payment of PHP 56 to a named recipient (Reynaly). This service documents the required preparation, required identification, the step-by-step in-branch process, reconciliation of evidence, and practical risk notes for customers and agents.

## When this service is needed

- When a client needs to make a small cash payment in person at a BDO branch to a named individual or office (for example paying a local helper, vendor, or an agent's on-site staff member).
- When the payment amount is small and a bank counter cash deposit / withdrawal provides the fastest, verifiable channel.

---

## Background prerequisites

Customers must satisfy the following conditions before an agent can perform or advise on a BDO branch payment:

- Geographic prerequisite: The payer or an authorised proxy must be physically present at the chosen BDO branch on the scheduled visit day if the bank or recipient requires in-person handover.
- Relationship prerequisite: None specific beyond the payer being authorised to transfer funds for the named purpose. If a proxy will act, the payer must give a signed authorisation letter to the proxy.
- Business prerequisite: Confirm the beneficiary name and the exact amount, and ensure the payer brings appropriate identification and the correct cash amount or bank card for withdrawal.

Not eligible:
- Remote-only requests where no authorised local representative can attend.
- Payments to unknown or unverified recipients — always verify beneficiary identity before transferring funds.

## Required items (what the payer must provide)

The following items are required and must be provided by the payer:

1. Payment amount
   - Exact cash amount to be paid (example: PHP 56).

2. Beneficiary identification
   - Beneficiary full name (as they will be identified at the branch) — confirm the spelling and any alias.

3. Payer identification
   - Valid government-issued photo ID (passport, national ID, driver's license) — original for in-branch verification.

4. Payment method
   - Cash: bring the exact cash amount for handover at the branch.
   - Alternatively, the payer may withdraw cash at the branch using their bank card; bring card, PIN and ID.

5. Authorisation letter (if using a proxy)
   - If someone else pays on the payer's behalf, a signed authorisation letter naming the proxy should be provided.

## What we can produce (service outputs)

- Payment confirmation note
  - A short agent-produced confirmation (PDF) that records the date, payer name, beneficiary name, amount, branch and any transaction reference.

- Photographic evidence (optional)
  - When permitted and with informed consent, a photograph of the official bank receipt or the beneficiary signing a handover receipt can be captured and appended to the case file.

## Process / Steps (in-branch)

**Total estimated duration:** Typically 15–45 minutes, depending on branch queue and the payer's preparedness.

Step 1 — Verify beneficiary details (before visiting the branch)
1. Confirm beneficiary name and any ID they will present at the branch (makes identification quicker).
2. Decide whether you will pay in cash or withdraw at the foreign's ATM/counter using your debit card.

Step 2 — Arrive at the BDO branch and present ID
1. Bring a valid photo ID and the exact cash amount (or your bank card if you plan to withdraw at the teller).
2. Inform the branch teller you intend to deposit cash to the beneficiary or hand cash over to the recipient sitting at the branch (if the recipient is present and the payment arrangement allows this).

Step 3 — Perform the transaction and collect receipt
1. If depositing into a beneficiary account (where applicable), complete the deposit slip with the beneficiary account number and name, present it to the teller and hand over cash.
2. If paying a named person at the branch (in-person handover under an arranged agent process), follow the agent instructions: ask the recipient to sign a short acknowledgement receipt and collect a photo / copy if permitted.
3. Obtain the official bank receipt and a copy of any signed acknowledgement.

Step 4 — Reconciliation and delivery
1. Provide the bank receipt to the case owner, vendor, or client as the official evidence of payment.
2. Update the internal case notes and attach a scan/photo of the receipt and any beneficiary acknowledgement.

## Price & Fees

- The bank imposes no special fee for a small in-branch cash deposit or handover beyond normal teller service for cash deposits. Agent handling fees (if we act on the payer's behalf) are quoted at engagement and depend on distance and urgency.

Example recorded evidence (historical): the specific case referenced a payment of PHP 56 to a named recipient (Reynaly). No bank fee was cited in the chat extract.

## Risk & Important Notes

- Verify beneficiary identity in advance to avoid paying the wrong person. Mistaken in-branch handovers are difficult to reverse.
- Keep the bank receipt safe — the official bank receipt is the primary evidence of payment.
- If using a proxy to pay, provide a clear signed authorisation and inform the receiving recipient in advance.
- Do not share your bank PIN or sensitive credentials with agents. If the agent withdraws cash on your behalf, ensure a robust handover receipt and a trusted relationship.

## Common Questions

Q: Can the bank hold my passport during the transaction?
A: No. Banks may verify your ID but typically do not retain passports for simple cash deposits. Keep originals with you.

Q: What if the recipient says they did not receive the payment?
A: Provide the official bank receipt and the transaction reference. If the payment was a deposit into an account, trace the deposit via the bank using the deposit slip details. If funds were handed to a person at the branch and there is a signed acknowledgement, the acknowledgement is primary evidence.
