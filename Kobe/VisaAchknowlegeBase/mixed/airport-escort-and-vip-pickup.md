# Airport Escort and VIP Pickup

## Summary

Airport Escort and VIP Pickup provides escorted arrival and departure assistance at airports for clients who require secure, private and coordinated handling. Typical users include executives, visa holders needing immigration support, families with children, VIP guests, and clients who require document handover or secure transport to a hotel or office. The service reduces boarding/immigration risk, expedites arrival/departure flows, and offers optional VIP meet-and-greet and document couriering.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following preconditions to request this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The service is delivered in-country only (Philippines) or at airports where the provider operates. The principal must provide arrival/departure flight details and a reachable mobile contact for real-time coordination.
- Relationship prerequisite: None specific beyond the requester being the passenger or an authorised agent for the passenger. For VIP access or special lane handling the principal must hold the correct travel documentation and authorisations.
- Business prerequisite: The client must provide accurate flight information (airline, flight number, estimated arrival/departure time), passport name as printed, and any special instructions (immigration flags, escorts required through diplomatic counters, medical needs).

Not eligible:
- Clients who refuse to provide flight and contact details or cannot authorise payment in advance.
- Services that require official immigration representation where the Bureau of Immigration or carrier forbids third-party handling without specific legal authorisation.

## Required documents and information (to be provided by client)

### Must provide
- Passport (scanned copy and the original for in-person escort where required): used to identify the principal at check-in and immigration counters. The passport will be handled only with client consent and returned immediately after processing.
- Flight information: airline, flight number, scheduled arrival/departure time, terminal and seat number when available.
- Local contact phone number and arrival airport meeting point instructions.

### Optional supporting items (recommended)
- Visa / immigration documents if arrival requires special handling (for example, pending BI order copy, I-Card, or AEP card) — original or scanned copies help the escort team coordinate with immigration where allowed.
- Authorization letter when an authorised representative needs to receive passports or signatures on behalf of the principal.

### Documents we can produce
- Service Receipt / Handover Receipt: produced by this service at completion to confirm delivery of any collected documents and to record the service details.

---

## Outcome / Deliverables

- Personal meet-and-greet at the designated terminal or curbside (if airport policy permits).
- Escort through immigration/customs to private transfer vehicle or lounge, or assistance to departure check-in and priority channels as requested.
- Secure handover of documents (passport, tickets) if client requests temporary custody for processing; agent will issue a signed receipt and return originals promptly afterward.
- Final service report including time stamps, photo of meeting (if authorised), and copy of the handover receipt.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Service duration is measured in hours around flight times; coordination begins at least 24 hours before scheduled arrival/departure (same-day rush options available on request).

### Step 1: Booking & Pre-arrival Coordination

**Estimated duration:** 10–60 minutes (admin)

Specific actions:
1. Client provides flight number, passenger name (as on passport), arrival or departure time, contact phone, and any visa/immigration caveats.
2. Service confirms availability, quotes price, and collects payment or deposit depending on provider policy.
3. The escort team confirms the meeting point, contact number, and contingency plan (delays, gate change, early arrival).

**Required information:** flight details, passport name, contact info.

**Note:** Confirm payment and any VIP lounge access or fast-track fees in advance.

---

### Step 2: Meet & Escort at Airport

**Estimated duration:** 30 minutes to 2+ hours depending on service scope and airport procedures

Specific actions:
1. Professional escort meets the passenger at the agreed point with identification signage.
2. Escort assists with priority check-in (if pre-arranged), carries documents, and accompanies the passenger through airline and airport security, immigration, and customs as allowed by local rules.
3. If collecting passport or documents temporarily to process on behalf of the client (for example to arrange an urgent reissuance or expedited check-in), the escort will issue a signed handover receipt and return the documents when official processing completes.

**Completion sign:** Passenger cleared and delivered to the agreed end point (vehicle, lounge, immigration counter, gate) or documents returned and receipt signed.

---

### Step 3: Post-escort confirmation & invoicing

**Estimated duration:** Immediate upon service completion

Specific actions:
1. Escort team sends a short completion note to the client with time stamps and confirmation that the passenger was delivered or documents handled.
2. Issue final invoice/receipt showing any additional expenses (parking, tips, fast-track fees) and collect outstanding balance if applicable.

**Completion sign:** Client acknowledges service completion and receives final report and receipt.

## Important notes

### Service limitations
- Escorts cannot override official immigration rules. Escorts facilitate and coordinate but do not replace the traveler or authorised representative at legal immigration checks where the principal's presence is mandatory (for example biometric capture or legal sign-off when the official requires principal presence).
- For some immigration-sensitive tasks (passport submission, visa stamping), the escort may require an explicit written authorisation from the principal and acceptance by the immigration counter.

### Timing & coordination
- Clients must supply accurate flight details and notify the service of changes immediately. Meet-and-assist depends on airlines and terminals; gate-level access is controlled and out of our control.
- Confirm arrival terminal and airline processing hours; after-hours or remote airports may incur extra charges.

### Risk warnings
- Surrendering passport or original immigration documents should be done cautiously and only with signed receipts; the escort service will issue a handover receipt and log custody chain.
- The service is advisory and facilitative; immigration outcomes (stamps, entry permission) are at the discretion of immigration officers.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Do I need to be physically present for immigration steps if I hire an escort?
A: For most immigration checks you must be present. Escorts can expedite queues and guide you to the correct counters. In a small number of cases immigration may allow authorised representatives to act, but this varies by office and is not guaranteed.

Q: Can the escort hold my passport while they process things for me?
A: Yes — only if you explicitly authorise them to do so. The escort will provide a signed handover receipt and will only hold documents for short, authorised processing tasks. Avoid handing passports when not necessary.

Q: Are the historical prices fixed?
A: No. The chat-extracted prices (PHP 15,000 / 18,000) are historical references. Confirm current pricing at booking.
