# BDO Bank Transfer

## Summary

BDO Bank Transfer is a straightforward financial transfer service that documents the practical steps, required information, and risk controls for transferring funds into a Banco de Oro (BDO) bank account in the Philippines. Typical users are clients, employees, or agents who need to remit payments or deposits to a named BDO beneficiary. The service explains how to coordinate funds, verify beneficiary account details, perform the transfer via online banking / mobile banking / over-the-counter channels, and confirm receipt with evidence.

This task is intended as an operational guidance and record for one-off transfers or for agents who assist clients in executing and documenting a BDO transfer. It is a single, independent solo task and does not include account opening or other banking products as part of the deliverable.

## Background prerequisites

Customers or agents must confirm these preconditions before performing a BDO bank transfer:

- Geographic prerequisite: The payer can initiate the transfer remotely (online banking, mobile app, or via Dragonpay) or in person at a Philippine bank branch. If the payer is outside the Philippines, confirm the bank/payment channel supports international remittance or a local proxy.
- Relationship prerequisite: The payer must be the account holder or an authorised representative able to use the specified payment channel and provide valid identity and payment authorization.
- Business prerequisite: The payer must have sufficient cleared funds (for example 1:1 funds or a funded e-wallet) for the instructed amount and must know the beneficiary's correct BDO account name, account number, and preferred reference string.

Not eligible:
- Any transfer where the beneficiary account details are unverified or where funds will be sent to unknown/untrusted parties. Avoid sending funds without independent confirmation of the recipient.

## Required information and documents

### Information the payer must provide (mandatory)

- Beneficiary full name (exact as registered with the bank)
- Beneficiary BDO account number (numeric, no spaces unless the vendor format requires)
- Bank branch code or BDO routing details if explicitly required by the payer's payment channel
- Payment amount and currency (PHP unless otherwise agreed)
- Payment reference or invoice number (the exact string the beneficiary expects for reconciliation)
- Payer identity verification: government ID or online banking authentication details as required by the channel

### Documents / evidence the payer should capture and retain

- Proof of payment: bank transfer screenshot, deposit slip photo, Dragonpay confirmation, or payment confirmation email. This is essential evidence to reconcile payments and to resolve disputes.
- Copy of the vendor invoice or purchase order that justifies the payment (if applicable)

### Documents the service can produce

- Payment confirmation note (producer: BDO Bank Transfer)
  - Document: Payment confirmation PDF summarising payer, beneficiary, amount, payment channel and transaction reference
  - Usage: Supplied to client records and attached to downstream invoices or procurement files

## Process / Steps

This section explains a practical, step-by-step workflow to execute a BDO bank transfer and confirm receipt.

Total estimated duration: same day to 1 business day for online transfers (faster when using immediate channels), or longer if manual bank processing or cross-border clearing is required.

### Step 1 — Prepare and verify beneficiary details

Estimated time: 5–15 minutes

1. Obtain the beneficiary's name exactly as it appears on their BDO account and the account number.
2. Confirm the preferred payment reference string (invoice number, case code or payer reference) with the beneficiary by a trusted channel (phone call, secure chat). Do not rely on forwarded messages without confirmation.
3. Optional: Verify the beneficiary bank details with a secondary contact (for example a known contact at the beneficiary organisation) to reduce fraud risk.

Notes:
- Small variations in spacing or spelling may cause reconciliation problems even when the transfer succeeds. Use exact text.

### Step 2 — Choose the payment channel and execute the transfer

Estimated time: 5–30 minutes depending on channel

Common channels:
- BDO online banking (BDO portal) — for BDO account-to-account transfers within the Philippines
- Dragonpay or other payment gateway — for merchant payments integrated with an e-commerce or billing system
- Interbank transfer (via payer bank) — for non-BDO banks transferring into a BDO account
- Over-the-counter cash deposit at a BDO branch or partner outlet

Execution steps (example for online bank transfer):
1. Log into your online banking app or portal with the required authentication.
2. Select 'Transfer' → 'Transfer to Other Bank' or 'Transfer to BDO' depending on payer bank.
3. Enter beneficiary account number and beneficiary name exactly as provided.
4. Enter amount and the payment reference/invoice number.
5. Confirm details carefully and submit the transfer. Record the transaction reference number provided by the payer bank or Dragonpay.

Special notes for Dragonpay: follow the vendor's Dragonpay payment instructions precisely (biller code, reference); Dragonpay may return a confirmation page or email which must be saved as proof.

### Step 3 — Capture proof and notify the beneficiary

Estimated time: 2–10 minutes

1. Immediately capture a screenshot or photograph of the payment confirmation, transfer reference and timestamp.
2. Send the proof of payment to the beneficiary (secure channel) and request confirmation of receipt.
3. If the beneficiary confirms receipt, retain their confirmation email or message as corroborating evidence.

### Step 4 — Reconciliation and closure

Estimated time: same day to 1 business day

1. If the beneficiary confirms that funds have arrived, update your accounting or case file with the payment confirmation and beneficiary acknowledgement.
2. If the funds do not arrive within the expected clearing window, escalate: provide the payer's bank transfer reference to the beneficiary and ask them to check with BDO. If needed, open an interbank tracing request with the payer's bank using the transaction reference.

## Price & Fees

This service describes the operational steps and does not impose its own payment. Costs that may apply:

- Payment amount as agreed with the beneficiary (example amounts recorded in related evidence: PHP 11,500 for a bar‑stool order via Dragonpay)
- Bank transfer fees or Dragonpay convenience fees — payer's bank and payment channel determine these charges
- Agent handling fee (if an agent is executing the transfer on behalf of the payer) — quoted case-by-case

Example: the source evidence for a related procurement shows a Dragonpay instruction: PHP 11,500 for a bar‑stool order (see Related Services) — the transfer amount itself is case-specific.

## Risk & Important Considerations

- Verify beneficiary details independently. Do not rely on forwarded messages that were not independently confirmed.
- Retain proof of payment and request beneficiary acknowledgement promptly to reduce dispute risk.
- For large or unusual payments, consider using a small test transfer first if practical, or arrange an escrow/verified payment flow.
- For cross-border transfers be aware of FX and intermediary bank fees; ensure the beneficiary will receive the expected net amount.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: How quickly does a BDO transfer settle?
A: Intra‑bank (BDO to BDO) transfers typically settle immediately. Interbank transfers can take minutes to several hours or up to one business day depending on the clearing system and cut‑off times.

Q: What proof do I need to show the beneficiary?
A: A screenshot or PDF showing the transaction reference, payer name, beneficiary name, amount, date and time. If using Dragonpay, save the Dragonpay confirmation page or email.

Q: What if I entered the wrong account number?
A: Contact your bank immediately with the transaction reference. Banks can sometimes trace and recover misdirected funds but there is no guarantee; recovery will require cooperation from the receiving bank (BDO) and the current account holder.
