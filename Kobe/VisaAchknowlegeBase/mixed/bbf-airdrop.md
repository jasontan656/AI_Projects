# BBF Airdrop

## Summary

The BBF Airdrop is a token distribution campaign run by the BitBetFlow platform. BBF has a total supply of 100,000,000 tokens; 20% is allocated to the founding team and 80% is distributed through task-based campaigns. The distribution is divided into 10 task stages, the first of which is an airdrop. Under the first-stage rules, an invited user placing a 1 USDT bet receives 100 BBF; the inviter earns 20 BBF from the invited user's subsequent referral level. The program is referral-driven and stage-based, designed to incentivize betting activity and onboarding of new users.
