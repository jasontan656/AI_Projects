# Bar Stool Payment via Dragonpay

## Summary

This is a simple payment-only service to process the purchase of bar stools by making an on-line transfer to a specified BDO account via Dragonpay. Typical users are staff or customers instructed to pay a supplier or vendor for bar stools. The service documents the required payment amount, the payment channel (Dragonpay), the beneficiary bank (BDO), the required payment reference, and the confirmation steps to verify receipt.

This is a single-step solo task: make the transfer and confirm delivery of payment evidence to the vendor and internal accounting.

## Background prerequisites

Customers or agents should confirm the following before proceeding:

- Geographic prerequisite: Payment can be made remotely via online Dragonpay flow or by visiting Dragonpay's supported payment channels. No physical presence in the Philippines is required to make the transfer if the payer's bank/Dragonpay access allows the transaction.
- Relationship prerequisite: The payer must be the person or entity authorised to make the purchase and must have the required account information and authorization to pay the vendor.
- Business prerequisite: The payer must have the correct beneficiary BDO account details and the exact amount to transfer. The vendor must be expecting the payment and must provide the Dragonpay payment instructions or biller code and the correct payment reference (invoice/case number) to ensure reconciliation.

Not eligible: payments made without a valid payment instruction or payments where the beneficiary account details are unconfirmed. Incomplete payment instructions will likely result in misapplied funds and processing delays.

## Process / Steps

Total expected duration: minutes to 1 business day depending on payment channel and Dragonpay processing queues.

### Step 1 — Prepare payment details

Estimated duration: 5–15 minutes

1. Obtain the vendor's Dragonpay/BDO payment instructions: biller code, beneficiary name, account number, and the exact payment reference or invoice number.  Confirm the total amount: PHP 11,500.00.
2. Confirm the payer's payment method (online banking, Dragonpay e-wallet, over-the-counter partner, or other Dragonpay-supported channel).
3. Ensure the payer's bank or payment channel supports Dragonpay payments to BDO and check any daily limits or cut-off times.

Needed items:
- Vendor payment instructions (biller code, reference)
- Payer's online banking credentials or payment method ready

Notes:
- If any vendor details are unclear, contact the vendor to reconfirm before initiating the transfer.

### Step 2 — Execute the Dragonpay payment to BDO

Estimated duration: 5–30 minutes depending on payment channel

1. Log into the payer's online banking portal or the selected Dragonpay channel.
2. Choose the Dragonpay biller or pay via the Dragonpay payment page using the provided biller code.
3. Enter the exact amount: PHP 11,500.00 and the vendor-provided payment reference / invoice number.
4. Confirm the beneficiary details carefully and submit the payment.
5. Save the payment confirmation: take a screenshot of the Dragonpay confirmation page and download any receipt PDF if available.

Needed items:
- Dragonpay confirmation screenshot or PDF
- Transaction reference number

Notes:
- Electronic payment channels sometimes show a processing delay. Keep confirmation evidence and monitor the vendor's account if needed.

---

### Step 3 — Confirm receipt and reconcile

Estimated duration: same day to 1 business day

1. Send the payment evidence (screenshot/PDF) to the vendor and internal accounts payable team. Include payer name, Dragonpay transaction reference, amount and payment date/time.
2. Request the vendor to confirm receipt and provide an official acknowledgment (receipt) once the funds have cleared into the vendor's BDO account.
3. Save the vendor acknowledgement and attach it to the internal payment record.

Completion sign:
- Vendor confirms funds were received and issues an official receipt or email confirmation showing the payment has cleared.

Notes:
- If the vendor does not confirm within a reasonable time, follow up with Dragonpay support and the payer's bank using the transaction reference.

## Price & Fees

| Effective Date | Currency | Amount | Applicable Conditions | Notes | Evidence |
|---------------:|:--------:|-------:|---------------------:|------:|---------:|
| 2020-08 | PHP | 11,500 | Single payment for bar stool purchase via Dragonpay → BDO | Payment amount instructed in source chat evidence. Bank/Dragonpay service fees may apply separately depending on channel. | message 5217 |

**Price notes:**
- The table records the instructed payment amount (PHP 11,500). Dragonpay or the payer's bank may impose processing fees or convenience fees depending on the chosen channel (e.g., e-wallet surcharge, intermediary bank fees). Those incidental charges are the payer's responsibility unless otherwise agreed with the vendor.
- Electronic payment channels may charge a small percentage fee; confirm at the time of payment and add the gross/net arrangement so the vendor receives the agreed net amount.

---

## Attention & Risk Warnings

- Verify beneficiary details before sending funds. Incorrect account numbers or references can cause irreversible fund misapplication and require time-consuming reconciliation.
- Always include the vendor-provided payment reference/invoice number in the Dragonpay form. Missing references can delay reconciliation and delivery of goods.
- For cross-border or foreign-currency arrangements (not typical for PHP BDO transfers), verify exchange rates and intermediary charges.
- Keep payment evidence securely stored and attach it to the procurement case file for auditing.
