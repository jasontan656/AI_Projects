# Birth Certificate Request

## Summary

A Birth Certificate Request is the administrative process of obtaining a certified copy of a person's birth certificate (for example a PSA birth certificate in the Philippines). Typical users include individuals who need an official birth certificate for immigration filings, passport applications, civil registration updates, school enrolment, or dependent visa processing. The service helps clients assemble the required identity evidence, submit the request to the issuing civil registry authority or authorised channel, follow up until the certified copy is produced, and then deliver the certified document to the client.

This task is a standalone solo service: it prepares the request, ensures required identity verification items are in order (for example ID copy), submits the request via the correct agency or authorised provider, and monitors the completion until the certified birth certificate copy is supplied to the client.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following preconditions before we can initiate a birth certificate request on their behalf:

- Geographic prerequisite: Many civil registry agencies operate nationally but require either a local channel or an authorised local representative to collect original certified copies. Determine whether the issuing authority requires in-person collection, a local authorised representative, or whether certified copies can be delivered by a courier service.

- Relationship prerequisite: The requestor should be the person named on the certificate or an authorised representative (parent, legal guardian, or person with written authorisation). Proof of entitlement to request the certified copy may be required by the issuing authority.

- Business prerequisite: Provide clear identity proof (government-issued ID) and the correct details required to locate the record (full name at birth, date of birth, place of birth, parents' full names). If the record has alternative name variants, provide supporting documentation to reduce search time.

Not eligible:
- Requests where no reliable identifiers can be supplied (for example no DOB, no parent names) and the registry cannot locate the record.
- Requests from unauthorised third parties without a signed authorisation or acceptable legal basis.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Varies by registry capacity and authentication method (same-day to several weeks). Typical turnaround using normal channels: 1–3 weeks; expedited or local service options may be faster.

### Step 1: Intake and identity verification

**Estimated time:** 0.5–1 business day

1. Collect the requestor’s identity document (copy) and the exact search details: full name at birth, date and place of birth, and parents’ names.
2. Confirm whether the requestor will attend in person or use an authorised representative or courier.
3. Provide the client with an itemised estimate of service options (standard vs expedited), expected timelines and any additional fees (government processing, courier).

**Required documents:** client ID copy, search details

**Notes:** Provide clear instructions on acceptable ID and on the exact name spelling used on the birth record; small differences lengthen search time.

### Step 2: Prepare and submit the request

**Estimated time:** Same day to 1 business day

1. Complete the registry’s request form or the authorised channel form, attach the identity proof copy and the signed authorisation (if a representative will collect), and choose the delivery method.
2. Submit the request to the civil registry office, online portal, or authorised partner service, and obtain a submission receipt or reference number.
3. If courier collection is requested, coordinate secure packaging and provide the courier tracking information to the client.

**Required documents:** completed request form, ID copy, authorisation (if applicable)

**Notes:** Some registries accept online requests and produce an e‑certified copy more quickly; always confirm the registry’s accepted submission channels.

### Step 3: Follow-up and monitor progress

**Estimated time:** Ongoing until completion

1. Monitor the registry’s processing status using the provided reference number. Contact the registry for any clarifications it requests (for example, proof of parentage or further identity verification).
2. For remote or representative collections, coordinate the authorised representative’s attendance and ensure they bring the required original ID and a signed handover acknowledgement.

**Possible issues:**
- Record not found → escalate with additional search criteria (older locality records, alternative name spellings) and advise the client on next steps (for example affidavit of non-availability if the record cannot be located).
- Request for additional documentation → obtain and supply promptly.

### Step 4: Collection and delivery

**Estimated time:** Same day as notice of completion

1. When the certified copy is produced, collect the original at the registry or receive it by courier depending on the chosen delivery method.
2. Verify the certified copy details (name, birth date, parent names and official seals) before delivering to the client.
3. Provide the client with the official certified copy and keep a digital scan for the case file.

**Completion sign:** Client receives the certified birth certificate copy and the service case is closed.

## Price & Fees

No fixed public retail price is recorded in the source evidence for this generic service. Typical cost components that the client should expect are:

- Official registry processing fee (varies by issuing authority)
- Agent handling fee (document preparation, submission, follow-up)
- Courier fees (for secure delivery of originals)
- Expedited service surcharge (if a faster production option is available)

Provide a case-specific quote during intake based on the chosen channel (standard or expedited), whether the client requires an authorised representative, and the delivery option.

## Important Notes and Risk Warnings

- Always confirm the exact name spelling and other identifiers before submitting the request — small inconsistencies can cause extensive delays in searching historic civil registers.
- If the registry cannot locate the record, some agencies provide an official statement of non-availability or advise on alternative documentary evidence. This is a separate process and may have additional costs.
- Originals submitted for verification are normally returned, but in some partner channels originals may be temporarily retained. Obtain written clarity on custody before surrendering originals.
- For immigration or consular use, some countries require additional legalisation or DFA authentication / apostille after obtaining the certified birth certificate. Advise early if the client requires the certificate for overseas use so the correct chain of legalisation is planned.

## Common Questions

**Q: Can you obtain a birth certificate for someone else?**
A: Yes, if you provide a signed authorisation from the person named on the birth certificate (or a legal guardianship document when applicable) and the required ID of both parties. Some registries have strict entitlement rules — we confirm requirements during intake.

**Q: How long does it take?**
A: Typical timelines vary by registry and channel: 1–3 weeks for standard requests using authorised partners; expedited local options may be shorter. We provide an estimated timeline during intake.

**Q: Is an original required for consular or immigration use?**
A: Many embassies and immigration authorities require the original certified copy and may further require DFA authentication or an apostille. Plan the legalisation steps early if the certificate is intended for overseas use.
