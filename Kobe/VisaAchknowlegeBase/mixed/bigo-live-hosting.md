# Bigo Live Hosting

## Summary

Bigo Live Hosting is a solo advisory and preparation service for individuals who want to work as live-stream hosts on the Bigo platform. The service helps clients who plan to host streams from home — typically to earn supplemental income while accommodating health or mobility constraints — by documenting the setup steps, essential platform requirements, recommended equipment, content and moderation guidance, basic monetization options, and practical risk considerations. The service is aimed at people who want a clear, step-by-step plan to start Bigo live streaming in a compliant and sustainable way.

---

## Background and prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions before they can use the Bigo Live Hosting service or start streaming effectively:

- Geographic prerequisite: Remote — Bigo hosting can be performed from almost any location with a reliable internet connection. No specific country residency is required by this advisory service, but platform rules and payment channels vary by jurisdiction.

- Relationship prerequisite: None. This is an independent solo activity. If the host intends to use a company or third-party to manage payments, a contractual relationship with that entity must be in place.

- Business prerequisite: The person must have access to a smartphone or PC with webcam and a stable broadband or 4G/5G connection. The host must be able to create and manage an account on the Bigo platform and, if required in their country, provide valid identification for KYC and payment purposes.

**Not eligible:**
- Individuals who are legally prohibited from participating on live-streaming platforms in their jurisdiction.
- Individuals unwilling to comply with platform community guidelines and content rules.

## Required materials and documents

### Documents / items the client must provide (cannot be produced by this service)

- Government ID (if the client needs to enable monetization or KYC): original or scanned copy. Many platforms require identity verification to withdraw earnings or to access certain monetization features.

- Bank or e-wallet details capable of receiving platform payouts: the client must provide accurate payment receiving information (account details, e-wallet ID) and confirm which currencies and channels are supported in their country.

- Personal information for account creation: email, phone number, and any profile details required by Bigo.

### Equipment and setup the client should provide

- Device: smartphone with decent camera (1080p capable) or a PC with webcam.
- Network: broadband or mobile data with stable upload speeds (recommend 5 Mbps+ upload for 720p streaming; higher for HD).
- Optional gear to improve quality: external microphone, ring light or softbox, tripod, and simple background.

### Documents / items this service can produce or assist with

- Stream setup checklist and technical guide: step-by-step onboarding document including account setup, stream keys (if applicable), first-stream checklist, and moderation settings.

- Basic content plan and script templates: 30/60-minute show outlines, viewer engagement prompts, and safety/moderation guidance.

- Monetization and payout guidance: a short advisory on Bigo monetization features (gifts, subscriptions, in-app currency) and recommended payout setup options for the host's country.

## Outcome — what the client will receive

- A starter pack PDF that includes: account setup steps, equipment checklist, sample broadcast schedule, basic content scripts, monetization setup steps, and a short risk/compliance checklist.

## Price & Fees

No fixed service fee is pre-set in this document. Typical advisory options are:

- Quick advisory (one-hour remote consultation + starter pack): nominal fixed fee (quote at intake).
- Full onboarding package (account setup assistance, test stream, content plan, monetization support): larger fixed fee quoted at intake, plus any third-party KYC or payment provider charges.

Price notes:
- Bigo platform fees or in-app purchase fees are governed by Bigo; platform takes a share of virtual gift revenue. Confirm the platform revenue split on the official Bigo documentation.

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Platform rules and community standards
- Hosts must comply with Bigo community guidelines and local laws. Adult content, illicit activities, or hate speech are typically prohibited and may result in account suspension.

### Health and safety
- For hosts who have health limitations, plan shorter, less physically demanding streams and consider scheduling frequent breaks. Use comfortable ergonomics and avoid prolonged continuous streaming if medically advised.

### Revenue volatility and expectations
- Live streaming income is variable and dependent on audience size, engagement, and platform mechanics. Do not rely on immediate full-time income without building an audience and confirming payout mechanisms.

### Payment and KYC risk
- KYC delays can postpone payouts. Provide correct ID documents and follow verified payout partner instructions to avoid long hold times.
