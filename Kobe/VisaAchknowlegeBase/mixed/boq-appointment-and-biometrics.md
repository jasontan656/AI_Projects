# BOQ Appointment and Biometrics

## Summary

BOQ Appointment and Biometrics is the procedure to schedule and attend a biometric or identity appointment at the Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ). Typical users are passengers or visa applicants who must report to BOQ as part of travel, quarantine, or immigration-related health clearance workflows. The primary requirement highlighted by operational evidence is that BOQ requires a clear 2x2 photograph taken at a professional photo shop (BOQ does not accept passport photos). Appointments are usually scheduled during BOQ counter hours; evidence shows the typical appointment window is between 8:00 AM and 2:00 PM.

This is a short, focused solo task: schedule BOQ appointment, obtain a compliant 2x2 photograph from a photo shop, and attend the appointment at the scheduled time for biometric capture or health verification.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to use this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The client (applicant or traveler) must be physically present in the Philippines when BOQ requires in-person attendance for the biometric or health appointment. Remote scheduling and advisory is possible but the capture is in-person.
- Relationship prerequisite: None beyond the person being the subject of the appointment (traveler, visa applicant, or dependent). If a representative will attend on the client's behalf, BOQ acceptance of representation must be confirmed ahead of time.
- Business prerequisite: BOQ appointments usually follow an existing travel or immigration process that requires a BOQ clearance or biometric record; confirm the filing or ticket reference that triggered the appointment.

Not eligible:
- Persons who are outside the Philippines and cannot attend in person and for whom BOQ does not accept authorised representation.

## Required documents and materials

### Documents the client must provide (must be supplied by the client)

- Passport (original or clear copy):
  - Type: original or clear scanned copy × 1
  - Requirements: Valid passport bio page. Bring the passport to the BOQ appointment if BOQ requires identity verification. 
  - How used: Identity verification at the counter.

- 2x2 Photograph (professional photo shop print):
  - Type: original printed 2x2 photograph × 1 (or the number BOQ requests)
  - Requirements: Must be a clear photo produced by a photo shop that meets BOQ photo quality standards. BOQ does not accept passport photos or low-quality prints. 
  - How used: Used for the BOQ biometric/photo record. Evidence indicates BOQ is strict and will reject non-compliant photos.

- Appointment confirmation (email or booking slip):
  - Type: copy / printout × 1
  - Requirements: The appointment reference or booking confirmation provided by BOQ or the scheduling portal.
  - How used: Present at check-in for the scheduled appointment.

### Documents or items this service can produce or assist with

- Appointment booking confirmation (producer: BOQ Appointment and Biometrics): we can assist with checking the scheduling portal, capturing the booking confirmation screenshot, and delivering booking instructions for the client.
- Practical checklist for the appointment: a one-page bullet list of items to bring and arrival guidelines (producer: this service).

### Documents obtained after completion

- BOQ attendance confirmation or stamp (if BOQ issues one): official acknowledgement that the client attended a BOQ biometric/health appointment. Use as evidence for downstream processes that required BOQ attendance.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Usually a same-day appointment (minutes for the capture) but scheduling and waiting times depend on BOQ availability; plan at least one working day for scheduling and a short visit window between 08:00–14:00 if evidence indicates that is BOQ's operating window.

### Step 1: Confirm requirement and schedule an appointment

**Estimated time:** 5–30 minutes

1. Confirm why BOQ attendance is required (travel health clearance, quarantine process, biometric capture) and obtain the booking link or contact number if provided.
2. Use the BOQ scheduling portal (or agent contact, if available) to find the earliest available slot. If the portal requires case or ticket numbers, have those ready.
3. Reserve the slot and obtain a booking confirmation (screenshot or PDF). Send the confirmation to the client and instruct them on arrival time.

**Need:** Booking reference, passport details.

**Notes:** Record the appointment reference and advise the client to arrive at least 15 minutes before the scheduled time.

### Step 2: Obtain a compliant 2x2 photograph

**Estimated time:** same day to 1 day

1. Advise the client to have a 2x2 photograph produced at a professional photo shop. Provide the required photo specifications (size, background, head dimensions) as per BOQ guidance where available.
2. Warn the client that BOQ does not accept passport photos—confirm the photo shop prints a standard BOQ-compliant 2x2 printed photo.

**Need:** One clear, shop-produced 2x2 photo.

**Notes:** Quality matters; recommend the client use a reputable photo shop. Evidence indicates BOQ is strict and will reject passport-style prints.

---

### Step 3: Attend the BOQ appointment and complete biometric/photo capture

**Estimated time:** appointment duration: 10–60 minutes (including waiting time)

1. Arrive at BOQ with the passport, booking confirmation and the shop-produced 2x2 photograph.
2. Check in with the BOQ counter, present the booking confirmation and identity document, and follow staff instructions for photo capture and/or fingerprint collection if required.
3. Obtain any BOQ attendance confirmation, stamp, or short receipt before leaving the office.

**Completion sign:** BOQ issues an attendance acknowledgement or the biometric/photo capture is recorded in their system.

**Possible issues:**
- Photo rejection → BOQ will request a compliant 2x2 from a shop; reschedule if necessary.
- Appointment mismatch → present booking reference and contact BOQ support if the slot is not found.

## Price & Fees

No official fee schedule for BOQ appointments was recorded in the extracted evidence. Typical considerations:
- BOQ biometric/photo sessions may be included as part of a larger immigration or health process fee; confirm official BOQ or agency fee requirements at scheduling.
- There is a direct cost for acquiring a professional 2x2 photograph at a photo shop (local market price).
- Agent facilitation fees (if an agent schedules or accompanies the client) are quoted case-by-case.

**Price notes:** Confirm all fees at intake and advise the client about the photo shop cost and any agency facilitation charges.

## Important notes and restrictions

- Photo quality is critical. BOQ does not accept passport photos—insist on a shop-produced 2x2 print. The client should avoid DIY passport prints from home or low-quality phone prints.
- Appointments are typically between 08:00 and 14:00 based on chat evidence; confirm the local BOQ office hours.
- The client must be present for biometric capture unless BOQ explicitly permits authorised representation for that specific step. Check BOQ policies before relying on representation.
- Bring original identification documents as BOQ may require them for verification. If originals are surrendered, confirm return timing.

## Common Questions

**Q: Can BOQ accept a passport photo instead of a shop 2x2?**
A: No. Operational evidence explicitly indicates BOQ is strict and does not accept passport photos; the photograph must be taken at a photo shop meeting BOQ quality standards.

**Q: What are typical appointment hours?**
A: Reported booking windows are commonly between 08:00 and 14:00. Confirm the exact slot on your appointment confirmation and with the BOQ office.

**Q: Do I need to bring the original passport?**
A: Bring your passport for identity verification. In many immigration-related processes the original is required at the appointment.
