# Amendment

## Summary

An Amendment service helps clients correct, update or modify existing official documents, registrations or records with the relevant government agencies or counterparties. Typical users include individuals and companies who need to change factual details (names, dates, addresses, employment periods, corporate articles, or visa-related stamps) after the original document was issued. This service coordinates document drafting, submission, fee payment, agency liaison and final collection/confirmation. It is a small, standalone solo task most often used when an existing record contains an error, requires an update, or when a formal change must be recorded to enable downstream filings.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to request an Amendment service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The client or an authorised local representative should be available in the Philippines when the issuing office requires originals or in-person verification. Some preparatory work can be done remotely, but final submission or biometric/photo capture often requires local presence.
- Relationship prerequisite: The requester must be the document owner (or an authorised representative) who has legal authority to request the change (for example the company officer for corporate amendments or the passport holder for immigration stamp amendments).
- Business prerequisite: The client must supply the original document or a clear certified copy and any supporting evidence required to justify the amendment (for example a corrected certificate, airline ticket for entry-stamp correction, or corporate resolution for company amendments).

Not eligible:
- Requests lacking any verifiable identity or document evidence that the amendment depends on.
- Matters that require judicial or contested legal proceedings rather than administrative amendment; such cases require specialised legal counsel.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Varies by agency and complexity (same-day to several weeks). Typical small amendments can be completed within a few business days; amendments that require publication, judicial steps, or inter-agency coordination may take longer.

### Step 1: Intake and evidence review

**Estimated duration:** 0.5–2 business days

**Specific actions:**
1. Receive the original document (scan and/or prepare for courier of originals).
2. Confirm the exact correction required and the authoritative evidence that supports it.
3. Identify the correct issuing office and the official amendment workflow (forms, fees, notices).

**Needed documents:** passport/ID, original document to be amended, supporting evidence.

**Notes:** If the original is missing (for example lost I-Card), advise the client to first produce an affidavit of loss or use a retrieval service.

---

### Step 2: Draft amendment request and collect fees

**Estimated duration:** 0.5–2 business days

**Specific actions:**
1. Draft the amendment request letter and complete the agency's required forms.
2. Confirm official agency fees and any service fees; collect payment or instruct the client on payment steps.
3. Prepare the submission packet and acquire signatures or notarisation if required.

**Completion sign:** Client authorises submission and fees are arranged.

---

### Step 3: Submit to issuing authority and track

**Estimated duration:** Same day to several weeks depending on agency queues

**Specific actions:**
1. Submit the packet to the appropriate office; attach supporting evidence and pay official fees.
2. Monitor the case and respond to any agency requests for additional documents or clarifications.
3. Collect official acknowledgement number or receipt.

**Completion sign:** Agency issues a receipt/acknowledgement and begins processing the amendment.

---

### Step 4: Collect amended document and confirm completion

**Estimated duration:** Dependent on agency processing time

**Specific actions:**
1. Collect the amended document or agency confirmation when the office marks the amendment complete.
2. Verify that the amended data has been recorded correctly and deliver the amended document to the client.
3. File the agency acknowledgement and update the client record.

**Possible issues and mitigations:**
- If agency requests additional evidence → gather and resubmit promptly.
- If agency refuses the amendment because the change is substantive (for example change of name that requires court order) → advise the client on the legal pathway and refer to counsel.

## Price & Fees

| Effective Date | Currency | Amount | Applicable Conditions | Notes | Evidence |
| 2021-03 | PHP | 2500 | Standard amendment handling fee referenced in chat evidence | Typical operational handling or advisory fee mentioned in chat logs; official agency fees are additional | message 41270 |

**Price notes:**

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Processing limitations
- Some amendments are administrative and straightforward; others (for example legal name changes, fundamental corporate article changes) require additional legal steps or judicial orders and cannot be completed by an administrative amendment alone.

### Timing and travel
- When an original passport or official document is surrendered to an agency for amendment, plan travel accordingly — the agency may hold originals during processing.

### Risk warnings
- Attempting to alter official documents without the correct legal basis can result in rejection and, in some cases, penalties. Always provide honest documentation and follow the agency's prescribed legal path.
