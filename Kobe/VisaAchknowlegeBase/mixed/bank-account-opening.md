# Bank Account Opening

## Summary

Bank Account Opening is a standard banking service for individuals who want to open a local bank account. Typical customers are residents or expatriates who require a deposit account, an ATM/debit card, and basic banking access for salary deposits, bill payments, or everyday transactions. The process requires the applicant to visit a branch, complete the bank's application form, present required identification and supporting documents, wait for account activation and card production, and collect the physical bank card. Representative (non-appearance) services may be offered by some providers for an additional fee where the bank permits authorized collection.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following preconditions to open a bank account through this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The applicant typically must visit the bank branch in person in the Philippines for identity verification and form signing. Some banks allow partial remote onboarding but will usually require at least one in-branch visit for final identity verification and card collection.
- Relationship prerequisite: None beyond being the person who will be the bank account holder. If a third party will act on behalf of the applicant, the bank must accept the authorised representative and the applicant must provide a signed, notarised authorisation in the bank's required format.
- Business prerequisite: The applicant must be able to provide valid identity documents (passport or national ID), and any bank-specific supporting documents (proof of address, proof of employment) where requested. Banks may refuse accounts without KYC-compliant documents.

Not eligible:
- Applicants who cannot present any acceptable identity document. 
- Applicants who cannot physically attend at least one verification event where the bank insists on the principal's presence.

## Required documents

### Documents the client must provide (cannot be produced by this service)

These are items the bank requires and that the client must supply.

**Application Form**
- Type: original × 1
- Requirement: The bank's official account opening form, completed and signed by the applicant. Some banks provide the form at the branch; others allow pre-completion online but still require signing in-branch.
- How used: Primary account application record. Typical bank policy: the original signed form is collected and retained by the bank as part of KYC files.

**Passport or National ID**
- Type: original × 1 (photocopies for file)
- Requirement: Government-issued identity document for identity verification and for BI or bank KYC. Passport is preferred for expatriates. The bank will inspect the original and keep copies in the account file.

**Proof of Address**
- Type: original or certified copy × 1 (utility bill, lease, bank statement)
- Requirement: Recent document showing current residential address as required by the bank's KYC checklist.

**Proof of Employment or Source of Funds (if requested)**
- Type: copy × 1
- Requirement: Employer letter, contract, or payslips when the bank requests source-of-income verification.

Notes: Banks differ on ID lists and acceptable alternatives. Confirm the specific bank's KYC list before attending a branch. Originals are normally returned after verification except for the application form which the bank retains.

### Documents the service can produce

- Application form assistance: fill and review the bank's application form on behalf of the client, prepare a clean signed copy to present at the branch (does not substitute the client's signature requirement).
- Representative authorisation template: if the bank permits an authorised representative, produce a notarised authorisation letter template for the client to sign and notarise.

## Documents obtained after completion

**Bank Card (Debit / ATM Card)**
- Type: original × 1
- Use: Cash withdrawals, POS payments and linked account access. The card is produced by the bank and either mailed or collected at the branch. Keep it secure and follow bank activation instructions.
- Custody: The card is handed to the account holder on release; activation procedures vary by bank.

**Account Opening Receipt / Welcome Pack**
- Type: official receipt / account details pack
- Use: Confirms account number, branch, and initial balance if any. The receipt is used for payroll setup, billers, and proof of account ownership.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Usually same day to a few business days for account approval; card production commonly requires 2–3 business days depending on bank and branch.

### Step 1: Pre-intake and document readiness

**Estimated time:** 15–60 minutes (client-preparation)

Specific actions:
1. Confirm the target bank and branch, and obtain the bank's accepted ID list and KYC requirements.
2. Prepare originals and copies: passport/ID, proof of address, employment proof if needed.
3. If the client wishes to appoint an authorised representative where the bank permits, prepare the notarised authorisation letter in advance.

**Needed documents:** passport/ID, proof of address, filled application form (if pre-filled).

**Notes:** Double-check ID acceptability for expatriates; some banks require additional documentation for foreign nationals (e.g., visa copy, local ACR I-Card) before account creation.

---

### Step 2: Visit the bank branch and submit application

**Estimated time:** 30–120 minutes depending on queue

Specific actions:
1. At the branch, present original ID and supporting documents to a bank officer.
2. Complete and sign the bank's application form; the officer will record KYC data and may take a photocopy of documents.
3. Provide initial deposit if required by the bank's product; many account types require a minimum opening deposit.
4. Receive an account opening receipt and a reference number; the officer will inform the client when the debit/ATM card will be produced and how to collect or receive it.

**Needed documents:** originals (passport/ID), application form, initial deposit funds if applicable.

**Notes:** The bank may perform internal AML or credit checks for certain account features; these checks can extend the processing time.

---

### Step 3: Card production and collection

**Estimated time:** typically 2–3 business days (varies by bank)

Specific actions:
1. The bank schedules card production and issuance; the client may be asked to return to the branch on a specified date or the bank may mail the card.
2. Present the account opening receipt and valid ID when collecting the card.
3. Activate the card as instructed by the bank (ATM PIN setup, phone activation or online activation). Test the card with an ATM withdrawal or a small POS transaction.

**Completion sign:** Client receives and activates the bank card and confirms access to online/mobile banking if relevant.

## Important notes

### Account restrictions
- Banks set their own account acceptance policies. Some banks require local ID (ACR I-Card) or proof of local address for foreign nationals. Check bank product eligibility before application.

### Time requirements
- Start the opening process well ahead of any travel or payroll deadlines. Card production may take several business days.

### Risk warnings
- Providing false or incomplete identity information can cause account refusal and potential legal consequences. Always provide truthful documentation.

### Special situations
- If the client cannot attend the branch, ask the bank whether an authorised representative is acceptable and prepare a notarised authorisation. Agent non-appearance fees apply as indicated above.
