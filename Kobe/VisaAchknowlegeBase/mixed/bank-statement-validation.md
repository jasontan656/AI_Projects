# Bank Statement Validation

## Summary

Bank Statement Validation is a focused verification service that confirms year-end bank balances for audit and financial reporting purposes. The process validates the bank balance as of December 31, 2024 by obtaining the official bank statement and reconciling it to the client's internal ledger and accounting records. Typical users are company accountants, auditors, CFOs, and compliance teams preparing year-end financial statements or audit files. The service produces a concise Reconciliation Report showing matched items, reconciling items, and recommended corrective actions for any discrepancies.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to use this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: Remote work is possible for document review and reconciliation, but physical access may be required if the bank or auditor demands original document inspection. The client should be prepared to produce original bank statement(s) if requested.
- Relationship prerequisite: The requester must be an authorized company representative (for example the finance manager, CFO, or an appointed auditor) who has legal authority to request the bank statement or to provide authorisation for the agent to collect it on their behalf.
- Business prerequisite: The client must have internal accounting records and a trial balance (or ledger) for the period being validated. If internal records are not available, the validation will be constrained to the data supplied and additional bookkeeping work may be required.

Not eligible:
- Cases where no bank statement exists for the required date or where the bank refuses to provide an official statement to the account holder or authorised representative.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Typically 1–5 business days depending on the responsiveness of the client and the bank, and the complexity of reconciling items.

### Step 1: Request and obtain the official bank statement

**Estimated duration:** 1–3 business days (depends on bank processing)

Specific actions:
1. The client or authorised representative requests the official bank statement for the account(s) as of December 31, 2024 from the bank. Where permitted, the agent can assist by drafting a bank letter of authorisation or coordinating with the bank on behalf of the client.
2. Obtain the bank's official PDF statement or a stamped printed copy showing the end-of-day balance and transaction listing.

**Required documents:** bank authorisation (if agent collects), account identification.

**Notes:** Many banks can provide a certified PDF same-day but some may require collection or a brief processing window.

---

### Step 2: Prepare internal records and supporting schedules

**Estimated duration:** 0.5–2 business days

Specific actions:
1. The client provides the internal bank ledger or trial balance to the agent. If necessary, the agent requests additional supporting schedules like check registers and deposit logs.
2. The agent maps ledger line items into a reconciliation template and flags items that commonly create timing differences (items issued but not yet cleared, outstanding bank charges, automatic credits).

**Completion sign:** Reconciliation template populated with ledger items and initial matches identified.

---

### Step 3: Reconcile bank statement to internal records

**Estimated duration:** 0.5–2 business days

Specific actions:
1. Perform a line-by-line reconciliation between the bank statement transactions and the internal ledger. Identify matched transactions, outstanding checks, deposits in transit, bank fees, interest, direct debits and credits, and any suspected errors.
2. Calculate the reconciled book balance and a bank reconciliation schedule showing the movement from the book balance to the bank balance at December 31, 2024.
3. Document any discrepancies that require client action (for example missing invoices, unrecorded bank fees, or duplicate entries).

**Completion sign:** A reconciled bank schedule and list of adjustments or enquiries for the client.

---

### Step 4: Produce the Bank Statement Validation Report and deliver

**Estimated duration:** same day to 1 business day

Specific actions:
1. Draft the final Reconciliation Report including: executive summary, reconciled balances, list of reconciling items, recommended journal entries to correct book balances (if applicable), and suggested next steps for audit evidence.
2. Deliver the report to the client and, where required, file a copy into the client's audit folder.
3. If the client requests, the agent can prepare journal entry templates or coordinate with the accounting team to implement adjustments.

**Completion sign:** Client receives the Bank Statement Validation Report and acknowledges next steps.

## Price & Fees

No fixed public retail price is recorded in the source evidence. Fees are quoted at engagement based on the number of accounts, the volume of transactions to reconcile, and the urgency of the request. Typical fee drivers:
- Number of bank accounts and number of pages in the bank statement
- Complexity of reconciling items (high volume of uncleared checks, wire activity, foreign currency transactions)
- Urgency (same-day request vs normal scheduling)

**Price notes:** Provide a cost estimate at intake and authorise work before the reconciliation begins.

## Attention / Restrictions / Risk Warnings

### Processing limitations
- The service relies on the bank's official statement as the authoritative source for the bank balance. If the bank will not provide a certified PDF or stamped original, the work may be limited to available evidence.

### Timing requirements
- When preparing year-end financial statements or audit pack submissions, request the bank statement early. Delays in obtaining an official bank statement can delay audit completion and tax filings.

### Risk warnings
- Significant reconciling items or unidentified differences may indicate issues requiring deeper transactional investigation or fraud analysis. The Bank Statement Validation Report will flag these items and recommend escalation to forensic accounting if needed.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can you obtain the bank statement from the bank on my behalf?**
A: Yes, with a signed bank authorisation from the account holder we can coordinate with the bank to request and collect the official statement. Some banks require the account holder to make the formal request or to collect the printed original in person.

**Q: Do you adjust our ledger for us?**
A: We can prepare recommended journal entries and, if authorised, work with your accounting team to post adjustments. Implementation of accounting adjustments is typically performed by the client’s finance staff or external accountant.

**Q: What if the bank statement does not match our cash book and we cannot identify the cause?**
A: We will document all reconciling items and propose investigative actions. For unresolved issues that appear material or suspicious, we recommend a deeper transaction-level review or forensic audit.
