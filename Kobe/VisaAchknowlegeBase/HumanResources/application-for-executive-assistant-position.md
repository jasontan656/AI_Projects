### Step 1: Receive application

**Estimated duration:** Immediate upon receipt

**Actions:**
1. Record applicant's name, contact information and date of application in HR intake log.

**Required documents:**

- If required items are missing, send a short request to the applicant asking for the missing document(s) and set a reasonable deadline.


### Step 2: Initial screening and shortlisting

**Estimated duration:** 1–3 business days

**Actions:**
1. HR reviews the application letter and resume for role alignment (skills, experience, availability).
2. If the applicant meets basic requirements, HR schedules a phone screen or initial interview with the hiring manager.
