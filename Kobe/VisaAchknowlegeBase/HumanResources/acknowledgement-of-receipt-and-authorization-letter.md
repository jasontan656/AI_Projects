# Acknowledgement of Receipt and Authorization Letter

## Summary

This service creates two short, official documents for housing (rental) matters:
1) An Acknowledgement of Receipt that records funds received (deposit and first month rent) and provides a signed receipt for the payer and payee; and
2) An Authorization Letter that designates an authorized representative (agent) to act on the payer's or payee's behalf for housing-related matters (for example to claim documents, sign handover receipts, or represent at property handovers).

Who needs this: tenants, landlords, property managers, or agents who require a formal, signed statement confirming payment and/or authorizing a named person to act on behalf of the principal.

When to use: at the time of deposit and rent payment, during move-in, for document collection, or when authorizing someone to transact for housing-related paperwork.

---

## Background & Preconditions

Clients must meet the following conditions to use this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: Service can be prepared remotely, but final signing (or notarization) usually requires the signatory to be present physically or to produce a legally valid e-signature where local law permits. Documents intended for use in the Philippines should follow Philippine local notarization rules if notarization is required.
- Relationship prerequisite: The principal must be the payer (tenant) or the payee (landlord/property manager) who is granting the authorization. The Authorization Letter only takes legal effect when signed by the principal or a duly appointed legal signatory.
- Business prerequisite: The payer must have the payment proof (bank deposit slip, transfer confirmation, or cash receipt) and identity evidence (government ID or passport) for the receipt to reference.

Not eligible: This service does not substitute for legally required transfers of title, lease amendments that require legal counsel, or any court-ordered documentation.

## Important Notes & Risk Warnings

- Always verify the identity of the parties before signing; the receipt must reference an authoritative payment proof to avoid disputes.
- If the receipt or authorization will be used for major legal steps (for example bank collateral or court evidence), obtain legal advice and consider notarization and witness signatures.
- The Authorization Letter should clearly define limited powers; broad or vague wording can cause misuse. Limit authority to what is necessary for the housing transaction.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Can the documents be notarized remotely?
A: Notarization rules vary by jurisdiction. Electronic notarization may be acceptable in some jurisdictions; otherwise the principal must sign before a recognized notary. The agent can advise the local notarization options at intake.

Q: Can the agent transfer funds or sign a lease on my behalf?
A: Only if the Authorization Letter explicitly grants such powers and if local law permits representation for that action. For signing a lease it is recommended to use a specific power of attorney drafted by legal counsel.

Q: What if the landlord disputes the payment amounts later?
A: The Acknowledgement of Receipt should match the payment proof (bank slip, transfer confirmation). Keep the original proof and the signed receipt; if a dispute arises, these are primary evidence.
