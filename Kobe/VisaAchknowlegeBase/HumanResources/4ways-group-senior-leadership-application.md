# 4ways Group Senior Leadership Application

## Summary

The 4ways Group Senior Leadership Application is the formal candidate intake and assessment workflow for senior leadership positions at 4ways Group. Applicants must submit an updated resume and a recent MBTI test result (within 3 months) as part of the screening. Candidates without a current MBTI result are required to complete the MBTI assessment on the recommended provider site. The process includes an initial application review, personality assessment verification, and a mandatory final in-person interview. This service is intended for professionals seeking senior leadership roles who are available to attend the in-person interview at the company's designated location. The process verifies fit, mindset, and capacity to accept leadership burden at an executive level.
