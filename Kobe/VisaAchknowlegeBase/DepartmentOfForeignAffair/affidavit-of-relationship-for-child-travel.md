# Affidavit of Relationship for Child Travel

## Summary

This service helps parents or legal guardians prepare, execute and deliver an Affidavit of Relationship (guardian consent affidavit) and related documents required for a minor child to travel with a non-parent guardian (for example an uncle) to another country (example: travel to China). The service checks the required supporting documents (birth certificate, passport copies, photos), prepares the affidavit in English, arranges notarisation (or consular legalization if required), and provides guidance on additional travel documents or embassy requirements.

Typical users: parent(s) or legal guardian(s) of a minor who need an executed affidavit to permit the child to travel with a non-parent adult.

When to use: when the airline, border authorities, or destination country requires a signed and notarised consent letter to allow a child to travel with someone who is not a parent.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to use this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The process can start remotely (documents submitted electronically) but notarisation normally requires the signatory to appear before a notary public, or at a consular office if the document must be apostilled or legalized for foreign use. The client must be able to attend the notary or coordinate with our local representative where law permits.
- Relationship prerequisite: The person providing consent must be the child's parent or legal guardian, or otherwise have legal authority to execute a travel consent. Proof of legal guardianship may be required in some cases.
- Business prerequisite: The child and accompanying adult must hold valid travel documents (passports) and any visa requirements must be satisfied independently.

Not eligible:
- Requests where the signer is not the parent/legal guardian and cannot provide valid proof of authority.
- Cases where the destination country requires court orders or additional judicial documents that cannot be created by a simple affidavit (those require legal counsel).

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Typically 1–5 business days, depending on how quickly the client can supply originals and whether consular/legalisation steps are required.

### Step 1: Intake and document checklist

**Estimated time:** same day (hours)

1. Client provides scanned copies of the child's birth certificate, the accompanying adult's passport bio page, and the child's and guardian's photos.
2. We confirm the travel itinerary, the guardian's relationship (uncle), travel dates, destination requirements (for example destination embassy notarisation or apostille), and any airline-specific forms.

**Needed documents:** scanned birth certificate, scanned passport copy, photos, contact details.

**Notes:** Some airlines and countries have specific wording requirements for the consent affidavit; we verify the required format at intake.

### Step 2: Draft the affidavit and client review

**Estimated time:** 1 business day

1. We draft the Affidavit of Relationship in English including: names, passport numbers, travel dates/destination, relationship statement, contact details, notarisation clause, and any witness blocks if needed.
2. Send draft to the parent(s) for review and approval. Revise once if needed.

**Completion sign:** Client approves the affidavit text and schedules signing.

### Step 3: Signing and notarisation

**Estimated time:** same day to 2 business days (depends on notary/consulate availability)

1. Arrange for the consenting parent(s) to attend a notary public; we can coordinate an appointment or meet the client at a notary (local service) if requested.
2. If the destination country requires further authentication (consular legalisation or apostille), arrange consular appointment or local legalisation steps and confirm fees/timelines.
3. Notary certifies the signed affidavit. If consular legalisation is required, deliver the notarised affidavit for the consular authentication process.

**Needed documents:** original passport(s) for signing parties, original birth certificate (for on-site verification if required by notary).

**Completion sign:** Notarised (and if required, legalised) affidavit obtained.

### Step 4: Deliver final package and travel guidance

**Estimated time:** same day after notarisation

1. Deliver the notarised original to the client in person or via secure courier if requested and permitted.
2. Provide a scanned package (PDF) with the affidavit and supporting documents for quick submission to airline/immigration.
3. Give the client a short checklist and practical guidance for airport check-in and immigration, including typical documents requested and recommended lead time.

**Notes:** If the destination consulate requires prior submission of the affidavit, we can upload or deliver the scan as instructed.

## Important notes & Restrictions

- Authorities vary: Different airlines, immigration offices and destination countries have different requirements for the exact wording and authentication level of a travel consent affidavit. Always confirm the specific authority requirements during intake.
- Notary vs consular legalisation: A simple notarised affidavit may be sufficient for some airlines and border controls. Some countries require additional consular legalisation or an apostille. We will identify the required level at intake and explain the added steps and fees.
- Original documents: Some authorities insist on original notarised documents at check-in; bring originals and keep scanned copies for backup. Avoid travel until the notarised affidavit and supporting documents are in hand.
- Risk: Not presenting the required consent documentation may result in refusal to board or denial of entry at the destination. Ensure documents are completed and verified well before departure.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can the affidavit be signed remotely?**
A: Notarisation typically requires the signatory to appear before a notary public in person. Some jurisdictions accept remote notarisation or e-notary; confirm availability and legality in the signatory’s location.

**Q: Does the consent letter need to be notarised?**
A: Many airlines and immigration authorities require a notarised consent letter; some also request consular legalisation. We advise notarisation as a baseline and confirm consular rules when the destination requires it.

**Q: What if the other parent is unreachable?**
A: If the absent parent cannot sign, additional documents (court order, proof of sole custody, or written consent collected in advance) may be required. This situation typically requires legal advice and more time.
