# Apostille Appointment

## Summary

An Apostille Appointment is an in-person appointment at the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) office in Mandaluyong (or other DFA consular offices) to obtain an apostille certification on public documents (for example birth/marriage certificates, affidavits, powers of attorney) for use in countries that are parties to the Apostille Convention. Typical clients are individuals or corporate representatives who need to legalize documents for overseas use. The service helps clients prepare the required documents, confirm DFA appointment details, attend the appointment (or arrange authorized representation where permitted), and retrieve apostilled documents.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions before we can assist with an apostille appointment:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal or an authorized local representative must be able to attend the DFA office in person at the scheduled appointment. Remote assistance is limited to paperwork review and appointment booking; the apostille itself requires in-person processing by DFA.
- Relationship prerequisite: The person submitting documents must be the document owner or an authorized representative with a signed authorization letter if someone else will present documents at DFA.
- Business prerequisite: Documents must be official public documents issued by the competent issuing authority (for example PSA birth/marriage certificates, notarised affidavits) and must be in the correct format accepted by DFA for apostille processing.

Not eligible:
- Documents that are not public/official records or private documents that require a different legalization route (consular legalization) rather than an apostille.
- Requests from persons who cannot arrange local attendance or an authorized representative when DFA requires physical presence.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Typically same-day for appointment attendance; DFA processing time varies by office load and may be same-day or require a short waiting period. Allow 1–3 business days in planning depending on DFA queue and document volume.

### Step 1: Intake and appointment booking

**Estimated duration:** 0.5–1 business day

**Actions:**
1. Client provides scans/photos of the original documents for a pre-check and supplies preferred DFA appointment dates.
2. We confirm document types and advise if any pre-requirements exist (for example notarisation before DFA acceptance).
3. Book the DFA appointment at Mandaluyong (or the appropriate DFA office) and provide an appointment confirmation and checklist to the client.

**Required items:** Scans of the original documents, client contact details.

**Notes:** Bring originals to the appointment. If an authorized representative will attend, provide signed authorization and ID copies in advance.

---

### Step 2: Document pre-check and preparation

**Estimated duration:** same day as appointment or prior day

**Actions:**
1. Perform a quick document pre-check to confirm each document is an acceptable public document and contains the required signatures/seals.
2. Prepare any cover sheets or forms required by DFA (if DFA requires a submission form or declaration) and print them for submission.

**Completion sign:** Packet is ready for DFA submission at the appointment.

---

### Step 3: Attend DFA appointment and process apostille

**Estimated duration:** appointment duration (typically 30–120 minutes depending on queue)

**Actions:**
1. Arrive at the DFA office at the scheduled appointment time with originals, IDs, and authorization letter if applicable.
2. Submit documents at the apostille/legalisation counter and pay any official DFA apostille fees.
3. Receive a claim stub or immediate apostille depending on DFA workflows; some offices issue apostilles on the same visit, others ask the client to return to collect.

**Required documents:** originals, ID, fee payment method.

**Notes:** Follow DFA instructions for queuing and document handling. Keep the claim stub safe for collection if the apostille is not issued immediately.

---

### Step 4: Collection and delivery

**Estimated duration:** same day to 1–3 business days depending on DFA release timing

**Actions:**
1. Collect the apostilled documents in person or authorize an agent to collect on your behalf using the claim stub and authorization letter.
2. Verify that each apostille matches the correct document and that the apostille certificate data (date, issuing office) is correct.
3. Deliver the apostilled documents to the client or arrange secure courier delivery as requested.

**Completion sign:** Client confirms receipt of apostilled originals and case is closed.

## Price & Fees

No fixed agent fee is recorded in the source evidence. Official DFA apostille fees and any service handling fees vary by office and document count. Confirm the current fee schedule at intake. Typical considerations:

- DFA apostille official fee per document (check DFA schedule at time of service)
- Agent handling fee for appointment booking and representation (if requested)
- Courier or secure delivery charges if the client requests document delivery

---

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Service limitations
- Apostilles are only available for documents that are public/official and recognized under the Hague Apostille Convention. Documents that are private or that require consular legalization for certain countries may require a different procedure.
- DFA offices may change appointment rules, walk-in availability, or fee schedules. Confirm all practical details during intake.

### Time-sensitive guidance
- Start apostille processing well ahead of deadlines for the foreign transaction requiring the apostille. Some receiving authorities and visa/immigration services require original apostilled documents that cannot be replaced by copies.

### Risk warnings
- If a document lacks the required prior certification (for example a missing notary signature), DFA may refuse apostille until the document is properly completed.
- Ensure the document issued by the proper authority (for example PSA for civil registry items); apostille on the wrong document type will be invalid for the foreign process.
