# Appointment for Authentication

## Summary

This service helps individuals schedule and manage appointments with the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) for document authentication (notarized document certification / consular authentication). Typical clients are people who need their public or private documents authenticated by the DFA for use overseas (for example power of attorney, corporate documents, notarised affidavits). The service explains how to book an appointment on the DFA website, secure the slot by paying required fees, prepare required paperwork in advance, and attend the appointment to have documents authenticated.

---

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to request this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The person requiring authentication must generally be in the Philippines or arrange for an authorised representative to attend the DFA appointment if the DFA accepts representation. Some preparatory advice can be given remotely.
- Relationship prerequisite: None beyond being the document owner or an authorised representative acting with a signed authorisation when DFA permits representation.
- Business prerequisite: The client must have the underlying documents to be authenticated (originals or notarised copies as required by DFA) and any supporting identification documents (passport, ID).

Not eligible:
- Documents that are not accepted by DFA for authentication (confirm document type before booking).
- Requests that require consular legalization or apostille for a country not using the Hague Apostille Convention — in that case use the relevant consular/legalisation workflow.

## Required documents

### Documents the client must provide (must be supplied by the client)

- Original document(s) to be authenticated:
  - Type: original or notarised original as required × 1 per item
  - Requirement: Documents must be the correct original form that DFA accepts for authentication (for example notarised affidavit, corporate articles, court-issued certificates). Confirm specific DFA requirements for each document type.
  - How used: DFA will inspect and affix authentication stamps or certificates to the originals or acceptable copies.

- Valid photo ID / passport:
  - Type: original × 1 (for in-person attendance) and a scanned copy for remote intake
  - Requirement: Government-issued ID used to verify identity at the counter.
  - How used: Identity verification at the DFA appointment.

- Authorisation letter (if an authorised representative attends):
  - Type: original signed authorization × 1
  - Requirement: The document owner must sign a simple authorisation naming the representative; include copy of the owner�s ID. DFA may require this when the principal cannot attend.

## Outcome / Deliverables

After the appointment and successful authentication the client will receive:

- DFA Authentication certificate or stamp on the submitted document(s): the official DFA-authentication evidence (original or endorsed original/copy, depending on the document type and DFA procedure).
- Appointment confirmation and a scanned copy of the authenticated documents and receipt (if requested): digital proof that authentication was completed and how the files were stamped.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** The appointment itself is typically completed on the booked date. Allow additional days for document processing if DFA requires internal handling; the total time may vary by office workload.

### Step 1: Appointment booking

**Estimated duration:** 5–15 minutes (online)

**Actions:**
1. Visit the DFA appointment portal and select an available slot for document authentication at the chosen DFA office (for example Mandaluyong or nearest DFA branch that offers authentication services).
2. Complete the appointment information: client name, contact, document type, number of items and preferred date/time.
3. Confirm the appointment and note the appointment reference. If the portal requires immediate payment to secure the slot, complete payment via the available channel and save the transaction proof.

**Required documents:** appointment reference, payment confirmation (if required)

**Note:** Some offices will only secure the slot after payment; others allow booking without payment and request payment on the appointment day. Confirm the requirement when you book.

### Step 2: Prepare documents in advance

**Estimated duration:** 0.5–2 business days depending on document availability

**Actions:**
1. Compile all originals and the number of photocopies DFA requires (the preparation checklist produced by this service indicates the number of copies and whether notarisation is required).
2. If notarisation is required prior to DFA authentication, obtain the notarised affidavit or notarial certificate from a licensed notary public.
3. Prepare identification documents and any authorisation letter if a representative will attend.

**Required documents:** original documents, notarised originals where required, photo ID

**Note:** Bring the appointment confirmation and payment proof to the DFA counter.

---

### Step 3: Attend the appointment and present documents

**Estimated duration:** 30–120 minutes depending on queue

**Actions:**
1. Arrive at the DFA office at least 15 minutes before your scheduled slot, with originals, copies, ID and appointment confirmation.
2. Present documents at the authentication counter; the clerk will check document eligibility and may ask for additional copies or signatures.
3. Pay any counter fees (if applicable) and receive a transaction receipt.
4. DFA affixes the authentication stamp or issues an apostille/certificate where applicable and returns the authenticated document(s) to you. In some cases DFA may retain documents for internal processing and ask you to return at a later time.

**Completion sign:** DFA issues the authenticated document(s) and an official receipt if payment is made at the counter.

## Price & Fees

| Effective Date | Currency | Amount | Applicable Conditions | Notes | Evidence |
|---------------:|:--------:|-------:|---------------------:|------:|---------:|
| 2022-09 | PHP | 5,710 | Per appointment | Quoted operational or bundled handling cost recorded in chat evidence. Clarify at intake whether this figure is the DFA fee, agent handling fee, or a combined package price. | message 227454, message 227507 |

**Price notes:**
- The PHP 5,710 figure appears in extracted chat evidence as a per-appointment value. Confirm whether this amount is the DFA official fee or an agent service package before collecting payment. Official DFA schedule is authoritative and may differ.
- Agent handling fees (if we book and attend on the client's behalf) are separate and quoted at intake.

---

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Service limits
- DFA authentication is document-specific: not all documents are eligible for the same type of authentication (apostille vs authentication). Confirm which authentication type the receiving authority requires internationally.

### Timing and attendance
- Some DFA functions (for example apostille) are only available at specific DFA branches or at scheduled windows. Book appointments early to secure a convenient date.

### Risk warnings
- If the document is not correctly notarised or originates from an authority that DFA does not accept, DFA will refuse authentication and the client will need to correct the underlying certificate or document before re-applying.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Do I need to pay before I book the DFA authentication appointment?
A: It depends on the DFA booking portal and branch. Some branches require full or partial payment to secure the booked slot; others accept payment at the counter. Always review the appointment confirmation instructions.

Q: Can someone else attend for me to get my documents authenticated?
A: Many DFA branches accept an authorised representative if the document owner provides a signed authorisation letter and valid ID copies. Confirm with the branch before relying on representation.

Q: Is this the same as an apostille?
A: Authentication can mean different things: apostille (for Hague Convention countries) or consular/document authentication for non-Hague countries. Use the apostille appointment service when an apostille is specifically required.
