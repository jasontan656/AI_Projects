# 13A Passport Replacement

## Summary

13A Passport Replacement assists foreign nationals holding or applying under 13A classification who have lost, damaged, or need to renew their national passport while resident in the Philippines. The service guides clients through the consular or Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) procedures, prepares required paperwork (for example police report or affidavit of loss), coordinates with the relevant embassy/consulate or DFA office, and monitors collection or delivery of the new passport. This standalone task is primarily consular/administrative: it does not change immigration classification but is often a prerequisite for Bureau of Immigration (BI) services such as I-Card replacement, visa renewal, or dependent attachment.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to use this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The client must be in the Philippines (or have an authorized local representative) for in-person consular appointment or document submission when required by the embassy/DFA. Some embassies permit mail-in or limited remote procedures; confirm at intake.
- Relationship prerequisite: Applicant must be the passport holder (13A principal) or an authorized representative with appropriate authorization documents.
- Business prerequisite: Client must be able to provide identity evidence (old passport copy if available, national ID, or BI documents) and any immigration evidence requested by the consular authority.

Not eligible:
- Applicants who cannot provide minimum identity evidence and have no way to obtain consular proof of identity.
- Cases that require a change of immigration classification rather than passport replacement (those are handled under BI services separately).

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Typically 2–8 weeks depending on the passport-issuing authority, consular appointment availability, and whether further identity checks are required. Emergency travel documents can be faster (often days), subject to embassy rules.

### Step 1: Intake and case assessment

**Estimated duration:** 1 business day

Specific actions:
1. Client provides basic identity details and describes the loss/damage circumstances; provide scans of any available ID and previous passport copies.
2. Agent assesses which authority issues the passport (home country embassy/consulate or DFA), researches required forms, and provides a tailored checklist and quote.

**Needed documents:** any ID copy, old passport copy (if available), contact details.

**Notes:** Confirm whether the client needs an emergency travel document for imminent travel.

---

### Step 2: Prepare required documents and file application

**Estimated duration:** 1–7 business days to prepare paperwork; appointment scheduling depends on embassy/DFA.

Specific actions:
1. Draft affidavit of loss (if passport lost) and arrange notarization where required.
2. Complete consular passport application forms, prepare passport photos, and compile supporting documents (BI evidence if requested).
3. Submit the application at the embassy/consulate or DFA office (in-person or by permitted mail service) and pay official consular fees.

**Required documents:** affidavit of loss (if applicable), ID, photos, application forms, old passport copy (if available).

**Completion sign:** Consular office provides submission receipt and case/tracking number.

---

### Step 3: Monitor issuance and coordinate collection

**Estimated duration:** 1–6 weeks depending on processing and production queue.

Specific actions:
1. Monitor the consular case; respond promptly to any additional identity verification requests.
2. Coordinate collection or arrange secure delivery of the new passport to the client or authorized representative once issued.
3. Notify BI-related service providers (for example I-Card replacement or visa renewal handlers) if the new passport affects ongoing BI cases.

**Completion sign:** Client receives the replacement passport (original) and issuance receipt.

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Service limitations
- Consular procedures differ by nationality; some embassies require the applicant's personal attendance and do not accept full representation.
- A passport replacement does not change immigration classification; the BI may still require the client to present immigration documents or re-endorse visas after a passport change.

### Time-related considerations
- Apply early if the client has upcoming travel; emergency travel documents are available in many consulates but have stricter eligibility and shorter validity.
- Processing times vary widely by embassy and by whether additional identity checks are required.

### Risk & caveats
- If the passport is lost and identity cannot be readily verified, issuance can be delayed or declined. Additional consular checks (verification with home country authorities) may extend processing time.
- BI processes that were pending or linked to the old passport (for example an I-Card replacement submission) may need to be updated once the new passport is issued.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Do I need to be in the Philippines to replace my passport?
A: In most cases you or an authorized local representative must appear for consular identity checks, or follow the embassy/DFA-specific remote procedure. Confirm at intake which option is available for your nationality.

Q: How long does a passport replacement for a 13A holder take?
A: Typical times range from 2 to 8 weeks. Emergency travel documents may be issued in days. Exact timing depends entirely on the issuing authority.

Q: Will replacing my passport affect my BI 13A status?
A: The passport change itself does not change 13A status, but BI records must match the new passport. Notify BI-related service providers (for I-Card replacement, visa renewal) so they can update records or re-endorse if required.
