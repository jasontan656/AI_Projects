# 9F Student Visa Application

## Summary

The 9F Student Visa Application is a Bureau of Immigration service to obtain a student-class 9F visa endorsement and the corresponding I-Card for foreign students enrolled in recognized Philippine educational institutions. Typical users are international students or their authorized representatives who need to submit school acceptance and registration evidence, local clearances, and immigration forms. The service covers document collection and verification, submission to the Bureau of Immigration, biometric/photo capturing if required, fee handling, monitoring and final delivery of the 9F visa endorsement and the I-Card.

## Background prerequisites

Clients must meet the following conditions to request the 9F Student Visa Application service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal should be physically present in the Philippines for submission steps that require original documents or biometric/photo capture. Some advisory work may be performed remotely but final BI steps often require local presence.
- Relationship prerequisite: None beyond being the student applicant or an authorized representative acting with proper written authorization.
- Business prerequisite: The client must have a valid passport and the school-issued documents that form the basis for 9F classification (for example Notice of Acceptance, Certificate of Registration, Letter(s) of Endorsement).

Not eligible:
- Applicants who cannot provide the core school documentation or who have immigration background flags that require legal counsel beyond administrative filing.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Variable depending on Bureau of Immigration workload and completeness of documents. Typical cases range from same-day submission to several weeks for final issuance depending on BI processing and any required biometric capture.

### Step 1: Intake and document verification

**Estimated duration:** 0.5–2 business days

Specific actions:
1. Collect and review all client-provided originals and copies: passport (with BOQ stamp), NBI clearance, Notice of Acceptance, COR, Letter(s) of Endorsement, joint letter (if any), and school representative ID.
2. Identify any missing items and advise the client on how to obtain them (for example obtaining NBI clearance or school registration proofs).
3. Confirm whether the applicant requires downgrading from 9G (if prior employment visa exists). If downgrading is necessary, include the downgrading procedure as a prerequisite.

**Documents needed:** all items listed in the Required documents section.

**Notes:** Ensure BOQ/arrival stamp is present if required by BI; missing or incomplete original documents will delay or increase processing costs.

---

### Step 2: Prepare BI submission packet and schedule capturing (if required)

**Estimated duration:** 1–5 business days depending on document readiness and appointment availability

Specific actions:
1. Complete BI forms and prepare the submission packet with cover letter and supporting evidence.
2. If the applicant is a first-time BI biometric/photo registrant or BI requires a capture for the I-Card, schedule the appointment and notify the client.
3. Collect the agent handling fee and estimate of government fees; obtain client authorization to submit.

**Completion sign:** Application packet is ready and biometric appointment (if required) is scheduled.

---

### Step 3: Submit to Bureau of Immigration and pay fees

**Estimated duration:** Same day to several days depending on BI processing and queue

Specific actions:
1. Submit the prepared packet to the appropriate BI office, present originals as required, and pay official BI fees.
2. Obtain the BI submission receipt and confirmation of biometric/photo capture if taken on-site.
3. Monitor the case until BI issues the 9F endorsement and I-Card production steps complete.

**Completion sign:** BI issues submission receipt and later releases the passport with 9F endorsement and issues the I-Card.

## Important notes & risks

- Ensure all documents are complete before submission. Incomplete documentation frequently causes delays and may lead to higher agent charges to fix missing items.
- First-time applicants will require biometric/photo capturing; schedule promptly to avoid processing delays.
- If the applicant previously held a 9G work visa and requires downgrading, the downgrading documents must be produced and may require a separate administrative procedure (for example DOJ/BI downgrading workflows). This dependency must be resolved before 9F endorsement can proceed.
- BI may retain originals during processing; clients should be prepared for temporary surrender of passports and other originals.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need to be in the Philippines to apply?**
A: Yes. Most steps require the applicant or an authorized local representative to be physically present to submit originals and attend biometric/photo capture when required.

**Q: What happens if I previously held a 9G work visa?**
A: If you previously held 9G status, you must provide downgrading documents (Order to Downgrade, cancellation records, or DOJ/BI notices). If downgrading has not been completed, we will advise and add the appropriate downgrading service as a prerequisite.

**Q: How long until I get the I-Card?**
A: I-Card issuance timing depends on BI production schedule. After submission and biometric capture, processing timeline varies from several days to a few weeks. We will monitor the case and notify you when the card is ready.
