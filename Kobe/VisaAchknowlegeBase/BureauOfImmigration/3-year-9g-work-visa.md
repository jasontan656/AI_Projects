# 3 Year 9G Work Visa

## Summary

The 3 Year 9G Work Visa is an employment-based work visa processed through the Philippine Bureau of Immigration for foreign nationals sponsored by a local employer. This variant requires a formal Alien Employment Permit (AEP) issued by the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) as a prerequisite. Typical users are foreign employees whose employers sponsor a multi-year employment authorization and who need a longer-duration 9G classification. The service covers document preparation, submission to BI, coordination of biometric/fingerprint capture where required, payment handling, monitoring of BI processing, and secure return/delivery of the passport and issued I-Card.

This service suits employees with employer sponsorship who already hold, or will obtain, a formal AEP and who want a 3-year 9G authorization. It resolves the problem of securing multi-year work authorization and a corresponding BI I-Card that supports downstream labor compliance and immigration processes.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions before we can process a 3 Year 9G Work Visa:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal (applicant) must be available in the Philippines for any BI requirements that mandate in-person attendance (notably biometric/fingerprint capture). Remote preparation is possible but BI frequently requires applicant presence for biometrics.
- Relationship prerequisite: There must be a sponsoring employer in the Philippines willing to support the 9G application and provide required employer documents.
- Business prerequisite: A formal and approved Alien Employment Permit (AEP) is required before filing with the Bureau of Immigration. The client must hold a valid passport with sufficient validity for the application period.

Not eligible:
- Applicants who are outside the Philippines and cannot attend biometric capture when BI requires personal attendance.
- Cases where the employer refuses to sponsor or cannot produce the AEP and supporting corporate documents.

## Required documents

### Documents the client must provide (cannot be produced by our service)

- Passport (original): original × 1
  - Requirement: Valid passport with sufficient remaining validity. The passport will be presented to BI and may be temporarily held during processing. The passport will be returned when BI releases documents.
  - How used: Primary identity and travel document for submission and I-Card issuance.

- Formal AEP (Alien Employment Permit) issued by DOLE: copy and original if requested
  - Requirement: An approved AEP is mandatory for the 3-year 9G application.
  - How used: Submitted to BI as a core eligibility document.

- Employer documents (examples):
  - Company registration / Certificate of Incorporation (copy)
  - Employer letter of sponsorship / employment contract (copy)
  - Latest company business tax documents as may be requested by BI (copies)
  - Requirement: Originals or certified copies if BI asks for verification.

- Passport photos and any additional documents requested by BI (for example previous BI records, I-Card if applicable).

Notes: If the client lacks any of the required documents (for example the AEP), those documents must be obtained first. Our service can advise on or coordinate AEP acquisition but DOLE AEP issuance is a separate process handled through Department of Labor workflows.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Approximately 3 months from submission to final issuance (subject to BI workload and queue). The evidence indicates an approximate processing time of 3 months; actual turnaround may vary.

### Step 1: Intake and eligibility verification

**Estimated duration:** 0.5–3 business days

1. Confirm client identity and employer sponsorship details.
2. Verify that a formal AEP exists or is in progress. If AEP is not ready, advise client and refer to Department of Labor (AEP) workflows.
3. Collect passport, employer documents, photos, and AEP copy.

**Required documents:** passport original, AEP copy, employer documents.

**Notes:** Filing cannot proceed without a formal AEP.

### Step 2: Prepare submission package and schedule biometrics

**Estimated duration:** 1–14 days depending on appointment availability

1. Draft BI application forms, cover letter, and assemble the supporting packet.
2. Coordinate and confirm BI biometric/fingerprint appointment if BI requires the applicant to attend in person.
3. Collect deposit payment where applicable (agent handling deposit if required by provider policy).

**Required documents:** full submission packet prepared, passport original available for submission/biometrics.

### Step 3: Biometric capture and formal submission

**Estimated duration:** Appointment day; queues and travel time may vary

1. Applicant attends BI for biometric capture (fingerprint/photo) if required.
2. Submit complete package to BI where necessary and pay official BI fees.
3. Obtain BI receipt and case reference information.

**Completion sign:** BI issues submission receipt and acknowledges biometric capture (if applicable).

### Step 4: Monitoring, final payment, and issuance

**Estimated duration:** Remainder of BI processing period (weeks to months)

1. Monitor BI case progress and respond to BI requests for additional documents or clarifications.
2. Collect any final payment from the client when BI requests balance payment for card production or issuance and process payment to BI.
3. Once BI issues the 9G I-Card and visa endorsement, arrange secure delivery or collection of passport and I-Card.

**Completion sign:** Client receives passport and 9G I-Card and confirms receipt.

**Possible issues and mitigations:**
- Problem: Missing AEP or employer documents → Solution: Pause BI filing and coordinate obtaining required AEP or employer evidence.
- Problem: BI requests additional evidence → Solution: Assist client to obtain and submit requested items promptly.

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Processing limitations
- A formal AEP is mandatory: the 3-year 9G application will be rejected or cannot be filed without an approved AEP from DOLE.
- Applicant presence: BI commonly requires the applicant's in-person biometric capture for work visa processing. Confirm whether an authorized representative is acceptable for specific steps.

### Time-related considerations
- The approximate agent-observed processing time is around 3 months from submission to issuance. BI workload, completeness of documentation, and payment timing can shorten or lengthen this timeframe.

### Risks
- Delays if the AEP is not complete or if BI requests additional employer evidence.
- If inaccurate or incomplete employer documentation is submitted, BI may deny or delay issuance — ensure employer documents are complete and valid.
