# ECC Filing

## Summary

ECC Filing refers to submitting and processing an ECC-related report or application with the Bureau of Immigration. ECC in the source context is processed after a 1-month extension when both actions are required consecutively. Typical customers are foreign nationals who require an ECC-related clearance or record update and who must have completed any short-term extension steps first. The ECC filing consumes some original documents during processing and those documents are returned when immigration releases them.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to request ECC Filing:

- Geographic prerequisite: The applicant must be physically present in the Philippines to file ECC with the Bureau of Immigration.
- Relationship prerequisite: None specific beyond being the subject of the ECC filing or an authorized representative.
- Business prerequisite: Any prior extension steps that are required (for example, the 1-month extension) must be reported completed before filing ECC.

Not eligible:
- Applicants who have not completed mandatory prior steps (for example, if a 1-month extension is required and not yet completed).

## Required documents (must be provided by client)

## Important notes / Risks

- ECC filing must not be attempted until the 1 Month Extension has been reported as completed, as the extension step consumes and holds the documents required for ECC filing.
- Documents may be held by immigration during processing and returned only upon release.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Can ECC filing be done at the same time as the 1 month extension?
A: Operationally the tasks are related, but the system requires the 1 Month Extension to be reported as finished before ECC filing can be started. In practice, this means you cannot finalize ECC filing until immigration has released documents and marked the extension complete.

Q: When will I get my passport back?
A: You will get your passport back when immigration marks the process as released and returns documents. The passport is typically returned at completion of the relevant immigration process.

The following messages are direct extracts from Telegram chat evidence and are preserved in original Chinese where present.

消息 13869 (2020-09-21):
1mo extension is occupying the document, because it is consumed to file. You have to report first 1 month extension to finish. Next is you start to report for ECC.

消息 13870 (2020-09-21):
When you file released from immigration, that's the time you can have the documents back. And 1mo extension will complete.
