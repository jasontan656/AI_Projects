# 9G Visa Downgrade Document Retrieval

## Summary

This service retrieves official documents needed to process a 9G visa downgrade. Typical clients are principals ending employment, employers/HR handling an employee exit, or representatives preparing a formal downgrade or I-Card cancellation. The retrieval covers locating and obtaining a certified copy of the former company's BI 9G order (9G ORDER), coordinating retrieval of an AEP cancellation certificate (if required and available from the employer/DOLE), and obtaining an ACR (I-Card) cancellation certificate or confirmation required by Bureau of Immigration processes.

This task reduces delays caused by missing documents and prepares the exact documentary inputs required to file a formal downgrade and I-Card cancellation with BI or DOJ.

---

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions before we can perform document retrieval:

- Geographic prerequisite: Either the principal or an authorized local representative must be available in the Philippines for in-person verifications or to sign collection authorizations if the issuing office requires it.
- Relationship prerequisite: The requester must be the visa holder (principal), the sponsoring employer, or an authorized representative with signed authorization. Employer cooperation is often necessary to obtain AEP cancellation records.
- Business prerequisite: There must be a traceable source for each document (BI records, employer HR files, DOLE records). If an original cannot be located, the retrieval service will escalate to a formal records search or additional downgrading services.

Not eligible:
- Cases where there is no traceable source for the required documents (for example, no BI record and no employer documentation). In such situations the retrieval may fail and the client will be advised on next steps.

---

## Required documents (must be provided by client)

### Passport (required)
- Type: original × 1
- Requirement: Valid passport presented for identity verification. The passport will be borrowed as needed during in-person verification and returned after completion.
- How used: Identity proof to match BI/employer records and to perform in-person collection where required.

### Authorized representative letter (if applicable)
- Type: original signed authorization × 1
- Requirement: If a third party will act on the client’s behalf, provide a signed authorization naming the representative and scope (document retrieval). This must be accepted by the issuing office.

## Documents this service can retrieve / produce

- 9G ORDER (certified copy)
  - Type: copy (scanned PDF + optional physical photocopy)
  - Source / producer: BureauOfImmigration record section or the original filing agent — retrieval is typically performed via the existing "9G Order Copy Request" process.
  - Usage: Required by downgrade and I-Card cancellation submissions.

- AEP Cancellation Certificate (copy)
  - Type: copy (scanned + physical if issued)
  - Source / producer: Employer or Department of Labor (DOLE) depending on how the employer closed the AEP; retrieval requires employer cooperation and might need DOLE coordination.
  - Usage: Verifies that the employer cancelled the AEP; used by BI or DOJ as supporting evidence for downgrade.

- ACR (I-Card) Cancellation Certificate (copy)
  - Type: copy (scanned PDF)
  - Source / producer: Bureau of Immigration (I-Card cancellation unit) or produced during a 9G downgrade / I-Card cancellation process.
  - Usage: Required for formal closure of immigration records and for ECC/exit clearance sequences.

---

## Outcome / deliverables

Upon successful completion the client will receive:
- Scanned certified copy of the 9G ORDER (PDF) — suitable for BI/DOJ submissions.
- Scanned copy of AEP cancellation confirmation or employer certificate if available.
- Scanned copy of ACR/I-Card cancellation certificate or official BI acknowledgement if previously issued.
- A short retrieval report listing sources, retrieval dates, responsible offices, and any outstanding actions required for downstream filings.

## Process / Steps

Total estimated duration: 3–14 business days depending on where documents are held and on employer / government office responsiveness.

### Step 1: Intake and authorization (1 business day)
1. Collect client's passport copy and, if a representative will act, a signed authorization.
2. Confirm which documents are required by the downstream downgrade/cancellation process (9G order, AEP cancellation, ACR cancellation).
3. Provide a work plan and estimated timeline.

Needed: Passport, authorization (if representative).

Notes: If the client cannot provide authorization and is not available in the Philippines, retrieval may be delayed or impossible depending on issuing office rules.

### Step 2: Locate document sources (1–3 business days)
1. Query BI record section for an existing 9G order using passport number, applicant name, or BI reference.
2. Contact employer HR to request AEP cancellation evidence or to obtain the company copy of the downgraded file.
3. Check BI/agent records for any prior I-Card cancellation receipts or ACR cancellation confirmations.

Completion sign: Issuing offices confirm the location of each requested document and provide collection instructions or scheduled release date.

### Step 3: Collect & verify documents (1–7 business days)
1. Attend in-person collection where required, present identity/authorization, and obtain certified copies or scanned copies as allowed by the issuing office.
2. Verify each retrieved document for legibility, required signatures/stamps, and compatibility with downstream submission requirements.
3. If any document is not retrievable (for example missing BI record), escalate to a records search or produce a formal status note explaining the absence and next steps.

Completion sign: Client receives scanned/photographed certified copies and the retrieval report.

## Price & Fees

No fixed public price is recorded in our evidence. The retrieval fee depends on the complexity, number of offices required, courier costs, and whether urgent/same-day retrieval is required. Official reproduction fees charged by BI, DOLE, or employer may also apply and are billed to the client.

Price notes:
- Quote provided at intake after confirming the list of target documents and retrieval locations.
- Additional urgent handling or after-hours collection is quoted separately.

---

## Important notes / Risks

- Some offices require the principal to be physically present; if the principal is not available, ensure the signed authorization is accepted by that office before planning retrieval.
- Not all documents are guaranteed to exist in retrievable form (for example if the original was never filed or has been archived under a different reference). In such cases we will provide a formal search result and recommended escalation.
- Official certified copies from BI record section or DOLE are the authoritative versions; photocopies from private files may not be accepted by downstream offices.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Who can request these documents?
A: The visa holder (principal), the sponsoring employer, or an authorized representative with a signed authorization that the issuing office accepts.

Q: Can you guarantee BI will release the 9G order copy?
A: We cannot guarantee release. BI has internal rules and may require the principal's presence or specific identification. We will follow BI guidance and advise the client of any additional requirements.

Q: How long does retrieval take?
A: Typical timelines range from a few days (if documents are on file and offices cooperate) up to two weeks or more when records need formal retrieval or employer coordination is required.
