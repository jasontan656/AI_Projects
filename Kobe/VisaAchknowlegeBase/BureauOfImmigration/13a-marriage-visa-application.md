# 13A Marriage Visa Application

## Summary

The 13A Marriage Visa Application assists foreign nationals married to Filipino citizens to obtain a 13A classification marriage visa. The initial grant is a probationary (temporary) 13A valid for one year. After a successful probationary period the foreign spouse may apply for a permanent 13A. This service covers eligibility assessment, document checklist, package preparation, submission guidance, and follow-up with the Bureau of Immigration. Typical clients are foreign spouses who need to regularize their stay under spousal basis and obtain an I-Card tied to 13A classification.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Dependent on BI workload and case complexity. The probationary stage is granted for one year; subsequent permanent application timing is driven by the probationary timeline.

### Step 1: Intake and eligibility assessment

**Estimated duration:** 0.5–2 business days

Specific actions:
1. Collect client basic data and scanned copies of passport, marriage certificate, and visa/entry evidence.
2. Assess eligibility and identify missing documents or special circumstances.
3. Provide a detailed checklist and quote for submission services.

**Documents needed:** passport copy, marriage certificate, visa/entry evidence.

**Notes:** Confirm whether BI requires personal attendance for submission or biometrics.

---

### Step 2: Prepare submission package (probationary 13A)

**Estimated duration:** 1–5 business days depending on document completeness

Specific actions:
1. Complete BI forms, draft cover letter, compile supporting evidence into a submission packet.
2. Coordinate client signatures and prepare passport photos if required.
3. Submit to BI in-person or via authorized representative when permitted.

**Completion sign:** BI provides a submission receipt and/or preliminary acknowledgment; if approved, probationary 13A endorsement will be recorded.

---

### Step 3: Probationary period monitoring and transition to permanent 13A

**Estimated duration:** Ongoing during the probationary year; apply for permanent status typically in month 10 of the probationary year.

Specific actions:
1. Monitor client status and BI communications during the probationary year.
2. Prepare and submit permanent 13A application near the tenth month of probationary validity (per evidence guidance: apply in the 10th month).
3. Follow up with BI until final decision. If permanent 13A is approved, coordinate for issuance of the permanent I-Card.

**Notes:** Timing to apply for permanent 13A may vary; the practical guidance extracted from evidence suggests initiating the permanent application around month 10 of the probationary year.

---

### Step 4: I-Card issuance and periodic replacement

**Estimated duration:** BI processing times vary; card production may take days to weeks.

Specific actions:
1. Once permanent status is approved, coordinate for I-Card capture (photo/biometrics) if required.
2. Collect issued I-Card and return originals to client.
3. Advise client on periodic I-Card replacement schedule required by BI (see Notes).

## Important notes / Restrictions

- Probationary vs Permanent: The initial 13A is typically a 1-year probationary grant. Evidence suggests clients should apply for permanent 13A around month 10 of the probationary year.
- Physical presence: Many BI steps require the principal to be physically present in the Philippines; confirm at intake if representation is acceptable for submission.
- I-Card replacement frequency: Evidence contains contradictory notes. One extraction states permanent 13A I-Cards need replacement every 2 years. Another line suggests Taiwan nationals replace every 2 years while Mainland China nationals replace every 5 years. The conservative operational advice is to follow BI's official schedule and confirm for the client's nationality at the time of filing.
