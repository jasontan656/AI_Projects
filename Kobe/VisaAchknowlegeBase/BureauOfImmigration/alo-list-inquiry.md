# ALO List Inquiry

## Summary

ALO List Inquiry is a short standalone service to confirm whether an individual is recorded on the Bureau of Immigration's ALO (Alien Landing Order) list. This check is typically requested by foreign nationals planning travel or return to the Philippines and by their representatives. The service uses the official internal BI system to make the search and returns an operational status to the client. The result is used to determine whether the person may re-enter, needs an administrative remediation, or must follow other immigration processes.

---

## Background prerequisites

Clients must meet the following conditions to request an ALO List Inquiry:

- Geographic prerequisite: This service can be requested remotely, but the client must be reachable by the agent for payment confirmation and for receipt of the result. If original passport presentation is required by the agent for identity verification, the client must provide a scanned image or photo of the passport bio page.
- Relationship prerequisite: The requester must be the subject of the inquiry (the passport holder) or an authorised representative with written authorisation to perform the check on behalf of the passport holder.
- Business prerequisite: The client must have a valid passport and provide the passport bio page (scan/photo) and the name exactly as recorded in the passport. The agent requires these items to perform an accurate system query.

Not eligible:
- Cases where the client refuses to provide passport details or any identifying reference — the check cannot proceed.
- Cases that require an official written certificate from BI: ALO List Inquiry uses internal system access to check records and typically produces an operational confirmation via chat or email; it does not produce an official BI-issued certificate.

## Documents the client must provide

### Must provide (client-supplied)

**Passport bio page**
- Type: copy / photo × 1
- Required: Yes
- Requirements: Clear scan or photo of the passport bio page showing name, passport number, nationality and expiry.
- How used: Used to uniquely identify the person in the BI system for the ALO check. The document is not submitted to BI as an official filing; it is used by the agent to find the correct record.

**Authorization (if representative acting)**
- Type: copy × 1
- Required: Yes when an agent or third party requests the check on behalf of the passport holder.
- How used: Acceptable proof that the requester is permitted to ask for the ALO check.

### Documents / items the service can produce

**ALO Inquiry Result**
- Type: original (advisory message / agent reply) × 1
- Produced by: ALO List Inquiry
- Path: BureauOfImmigration/alo-list-inquiry.md
- How used: Operational confirmation whether the client is recorded on the ALO list. The output is an advisory message or a short report provided to the client. Note: The service commonly provides results only as a chat message or email; BI does not usually issue a formal certificate for this informal check.

---

## Outcome / Deliverables

- ALO Inquiry Result (agent report / chat message): states whether the client has an ALO record in BI internal systems and outlines the immediate implications (for example likely need for administrative remediation or that they are clear to travel). The report will specify date/time of the check and the identifying values used.

- Recommended next steps: If the client is on the list, the agent will advise on available remediation services (for example ALO Lifting, airport exit arrangements, or legal counsel) and provide links/prices where applicable.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Typically same-day to next business day depending on agent workload and payment confirmation.

### Step 1: Intake and identity confirmation

**Estimated duration:** within 24 hours

**Actions:**
1. Client provides a clear scan or photo of the passport bio page and the full name as written on passport.
2. If the request is being made by an authorised representative, the representative also provides a signed authorization.
3. Agent confirms receipt of identifying documents and provides a payment instruction.

**Required items:** passport bio page (scan), authorization if applicable.

**Notes:** Identity match is crucial — small spelling differences can lead to wrong matches in the BI system.

---

### Step 2: Payment and service confirmation

**Estimated duration:** immediate once payment is received

**Actions:**
1. Client pays the service fee (typical fee: PHP 1500). Payment channels commonly accepted: GCash, bank transfer, 7-11 or other local channels as agreed with the agent.
2. Agent confirms payment and schedules the system query.

**Required items:** payment confirmation / receipt.

**Notes:** Many agents require payment before initiating the internal BI query.

---

### Step 3: BI system query

**Estimated duration:** same day (often within hours) or next business day

**Actions:**
1. Agent performs an internal search of BI ALO/immigration flags using the passport number and name supplied.
2. Agent records the query result and any internal reference used to obtain the result.

**Completion sign:** Agent captures the system outcome (ALO record found / no ALO record) and prepares the advisory message for the client.

**Notes:** The agent uses official system access; the service does not rely on unofficial social-media lists.

---

### Step 4: Report result and advise next steps

**Estimated duration:** immediate after query

**Actions:**
1. Agent delivers the check result to the client via the agreed communication channel (chat or email). The result will state whether an ALO record exists and, if so, brief implications and recommended remediation services.
2. If ALO is present, agent proposes options (ALO Lifting, airport exit channels, visa remediation) with indicative prices and timelines.
3. If no record is found, agent issues a short advisory confirming the result and any recommended follow-up if the client must show evidence to a third party (note that agents typically cannot produce an official BI certificate for the absence of records).

**Completion sign:** Client receives the advisory report and acknowledges next steps.

## Price & Conditions

| Effective Date | Currency | Amount | Applicable Conditions | Notes | Evidence |
|---------------:|:--------:|------:|----------------------|------|---------:|
| 2024-12 | PHP | 1500 | Per single ALO system check | Typical single-check fee reported across multiple chat records | Multiple extracted chat threads (agent discussions) |

**Payment notes:**
- Common payment channels recorded: GCash, bank transfer, 7-11. Confirm the agent's accepted payment methods at intake.
- The fee covers one passport-number query. Re-checks or queries for multiple passport numbers require separate payments.

---

## Notes & Limitations

### Service limitations
- The ALO List Inquiry is an operational internal-system check performed by an agent with system access and is not a formal BI-issued certificate. Clients requiring an official BI document should be referred to formal BI channels and may need to follow different procedures.
- Agents generally do not provide screenshots of BI internal records; results are given as advisory messages. In a few cases, agents may quote that screenshots are not available by policy.

### Time and frequency
- The ALO record is dynamic. A negative result (no record) reflects status at the moment of the check; the client should re-check close to travel if time elapses.

### Risk & privacy
- Clients must provide accurate passport data. Using incorrect identifiers may return false negatives or false positives.
- The agent will not share passport copies or query results with third parties without the client's explicit consent.

## Common Questions

**Q: What does a 'no record' result mean?**
A: It means the BI internal ALO list did not show an ALO recorded against the passport number and name at the time of the check. It is not an official certificate but is an operational confirmation used in client planning.

**Q: Can you provide a signed BI certificate that I am not on the ALO list?**
A: No. This service uses internal access to check the ALO status and provides an advisory result. For official BI certificates or legal confirmations, the client must request formal documentation directly from the Bureau of Immigration.

**Q: How quickly can you check?**
A: Most checks are completed the same day once payment and identity are confirmed. Some checks are delivered the next business day depending on agent workflow.
