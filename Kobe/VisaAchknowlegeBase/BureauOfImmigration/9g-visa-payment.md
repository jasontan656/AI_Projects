# 9G Visa Payment

## Summary

9G Visa Payment is a single-purpose service that handles the collection, processing, recording and confirmation of payments required for Bureau of Immigration 9G visa filings. Typical users are visa applicants or their employers/HR who must transfer or deposit the required agent/Bureau payment (deposit and/or final balance) into a designated bank account and provide verifiable proof of payment. This service accepts and verifies bank deposit slips or e-payment receipts, records the payment in the case file, issues an internal payment confirmation to the visa filing agent, and supplies the payment evidence required for subsequent immigration filing steps.

This task is commonly used when a 9G application (2-year or 3-year) requires an agent-handling deposit or a full package payment before filing can proceed. It is a standalone operational subtask but is closely related to 9G Application and duration-specific 9G services (for example 2 Year 9G Work Visa).

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to use this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: Payment may be made remotely (bank transfer) from outside the Philippines, but the payer must be able to produce verifiable payment evidence (bank transaction reference, screenshot, or scanned deposit slip). If agent policy requires an in-person deposit, the payer or authorized representative must be physically present in the Philippines.
- Relationship prerequisite: The payer must be the visa applicant, employer, or an authorized party with written payment authorization linking the payment to the named applicant(s) (for example passport number or case reference).
- Business prerequisite: The case must have an agreed invoice or payment instruction from the handling agent specifying the amount, bank account, and reference code. The payment cannot be accepted without linking information (applicant name / passport / booking reference).

Not eligible:
- Anonymous payments with no identification or invalid/missing payment reference.
- Payments into incorrect or unverifiable accounts without prior written instruction from the agent.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Usually same-day to 2 business days depending on banking clearing and response time for verification.

### Step 1: Confirm invoice and payment details

**Estimated duration:** same day

**Actions:**
1. Agent confirms the required amount and the designated beneficiary account with the client (the client must accept the instruction in writing or via chat). Include the case reference or applicant name that must appear with the transfer.
2. Provide the exact bank details: bank name, branch, account number, beneficiary name, and any required reference line.

**Notes:** Do not accept payments to accounts not explicitly authorized in writing by the agent. Verify account name before instructing the client to transfer.

### Step 2: Client initiates payment

**Estimated duration:** minutes to same day (depending on payer)

**Actions:**
1. Client makes the deposit or bank transfer (e.g., BDO deposit). Example instruction (extracted from chat evidence): deposit PHP 99,900 to the BDO account of Rubilyn Velasco Villar.
2. Client obtains proof of payment: deposit slip photo or e-banking confirmation screenshot showing transaction reference.

**Required evidence to provide to agent:** transaction reference, screenshot/photo of confirmation, payer name, date/time, amount.

### Step 3: Agent verification and recording

**Estimated duration:** same day to 1 business day

**Actions:**
1. Agent verifies the transaction against the beneficiary account (cross-check bank notification or internal cashier group confirmation).
2. Agent records payment in the case file and issues an internal Payment Confirmation PDF to the client showing submitted evidence and confirming the amount received.
3. If bank processing fees were charged and the amount received differs, reconcile with the client and obtain any shortfall funds if required.

**Completion sign:** Payment Confirmation delivered to client and payment recorded in case system.

### Step 4: Attach payment evidence to application workflow

**Estimated duration:** same day

**Actions:**
1. Attach the Payment Confirmation and the raw payment evidence to the 9G application packet or internal case folder. This evidence is used to support filing steps that require deposit/final payment proof.
2. If BI requires the official agent to produce the BI payment receipt at submission, prepare the BI evidence copy and include it in the submission package.

**Notes:** Keep copies of both the original payment evidence and the agent-produced confirmation in the case log.

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Payment safety
- Always verify and confirm the receiving bank account name before making payment. Fraudulent account instructions are a known risk.
- If the payer suspects a wrong account instruction, stop the transfer immediately and confirm by a second channel (phone call) with the agent.

### Proof requirements
- A bank confirmation or official deposit slip that includes the transaction reference is mandatory. A blurry photo or partial screenshot may not be accepted; request a clear image.

### Payment reconciliation
- Agent will not proceed to schedule BI appointments (for biometrics or filing) until required deposit or balance is recorded and reconciled per the agent's payment policy.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Can I pay by e-wallet or credit card?
A: Payment channels depend on the agent's accepted methods. Bank deposit or bank transfer is the common channel. E-wallet or credit card payments must be pre-agreed and may incur additional merchant fees that the payer must cover.

Q: What if the bank transfer shows a small fee and the beneficiary received less than the required amount?
A: The payer must top up the shortfall so the beneficiary receives the full instructed amount. Alternatively, the payer and agent can agree that the payer covers the transfer fee on top of the instructed amount.

Q: Will the Payment Confirmation serve as the BI receipt?
A: No. The Payment Confirmation is the agent's internal confirmation of receipt. Official BI fees are payable to BI and BI will issue its own receipts when relevant.
