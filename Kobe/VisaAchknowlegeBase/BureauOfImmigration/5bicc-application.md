# 5BICC Application

## Summary

The 5BICC Application is a short, single-purpose administrative process to apply for a BICC-related confirmation or record (referred to in source chats as "5BICC"). The service primarily verifies whether a client needs a BICC and, in cases where multiple clients share identical names, checks for or secures an NTSP certificate as an auxiliary identity document. Typical users are clients who have ambiguous identity records or whose cases require an NTSP to disambiguate their identity before BICC processing. The service helps determine necessity, verify client files, request NTSP if required, and submit the 5BICC application to the responsible authority.

## Background prerequisites

Clients must meet the following conditions to proceed with this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The client or an authorized local representative should be available in the Philippines when original documents must be presented or when the issuing office requires in-person submission. Remote advisory is possible for document checks.
- Relationship prerequisite: None specific beyond being the subject of the BICC record or an authorized representative able to provide necessary identity documents.
- Business prerequisite: The client must provide identity documents that allow us to verify whether an NTSP is already present in their file (for example existing immigration or identity certificates). If the client does not have required identity documents, the NTSP application must be completed first when applicable.

Not eligible:
- Cases where identity ambiguity cannot be resolved by NTSP or related administrative certificates and require court or consular adjudication.

## Required documents

### Documents the client must provide (cannot be produced by this service)

- NTSP Certificate:
  - Type: original × 1
  - Requirement: If applicable (see process). Must be the original NTSP certificate when the client's case requires one. The NTSP is used to disambiguate clients who share identical names.
  - How used: Borrowed during processing and returned when the issuing office releases documents.
  - Mandatory: Yes (only when the client needs NTSP; otherwise not required).

- Identity evidence (minimum):
  - Passport copy or ID copy (copy/scan) × 1
  - Requirement: Used to verify identity and check whether NTSP is already present in client files.
  - How used: For initial verification; originals may be requested by the issuing office.

Notes: The only explicit document extracted from source evidence is the NTSP certificate. Agents should request passports and any existing BI/agency documents to perform effective checks.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Typically same-day to a few business days depending on whether NTSP is required and the response time of the issuing office.

### Step 1: Intake & identity check

**Estimated duration:** Same day

Specific actions:
1. Collect client's basic details and scanned copies of identity documents (passport, existing immigration records).
2. Check client files and available records to determine whether a BICC is necessary for the client's immediate need.
3. Specifically check existing documents to confirm whether an NTSP certificate already exists.

**Needed documents:** passport copy, any existing NTSP (if client claims to have one).

**Completion sign:** Clarify whether the client requires BICC and whether NTSP is already present.

**Notes:** Some clients do not need BICC; this step ensures we do not file unnecessary applications.

---

### Step 2: NTSP handling (conditional)

**Estimated duration:** 1–7 business days (if an NTSP application is required and accepted by the issuing office)

Specific actions:
1. If client has name-conflict or identity ambiguity and no NTSP exists, advise client that NTSP is required and request authorization to apply on their behalf or provide guidance for client-led submission.
2. Prepare NTSP application forms and supporting documents; obtain client signatures/authorizations as required.
3. Submit NTSP application to the relevant office and track progress until issuance.

**Needed documents:** passport original or copy, any supporting identity proof requested by NTSP process, client authorization for agent representation (if agent files).

**Completion sign:** NTSP certificate issued and returned (or confirmed in client file).

---

### Step 3: Submit 5BICC application

**Estimated duration:** Same day to several days depending on authority processing

Specific actions:
1. Assemble the 5BICC application packet, including NTSP (if applicable) and other required identity evidence.
2. Submit the 5BICC application to the relevant office and pay any official fees.
3. Monitor progress and follow up until 5BICC confirmation/receipt is obtained.
4. Return originals to client when the issuing office releases them.

**Needed documents:** NTSP certificate (if applied), passport original or copy as required, submission receipt.

**Completion sign:** Client receives official 5BICC confirmation/receipt.

## Price & Fees

No fixed service price is recorded in the available source evidence. Official fees (if any) for NTSP or 5BICC are payable to the issuing authority. Agent handling fees (if any) must be quoted at intake depending on whether NTSP application is required and the level of representation requested.

**Price notes:**
- If NTSP is needed and the agent must apply, quote will include NTSP handling and BICC submission time. Confirm fees during intake.

---

## Important notes / Restrictions

- Not all clients require 5BICC — step 1 is essential to avoid unnecessary filings.
- NTSP is only required when identity conflicts (for example identical names) prevent the straightforward issuance or identification of a BICC record.
- Some issuing offices require originals for submission and may hold documents temporarily; prepare client for temporary surrender and safe custody procedures.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Do I always need NTSP to apply for 5BICC?
A: No. NTSP is only required when there is identity ambiguity (for example multiple clients with the same name). During intake we check existing files to confirm whether NTSP is necessary.

Q: Will my original documents be returned?
A: In most cases originals are borrowed during processing and returned when the issuing authority releases documents; confirm at intake if the authority will retain originals.

Q: How long does the 5BICC process take?
A: If no NTSP is needed, it can be same-day to a few days. If NTSP application is required, add NTSP processing time (variable, commonly within days to weeks depending on the office).
