# 9G Return Tax Payment

## Summary

9G Return Tax Payment documents the practical requirement and expected agent handling costs when a holder of a 9G work visa needs to pay small administrative tax/fee items related to returning to their home country (as recorded in chat evidence). The extracted evidence records two commonly-cited amounts: an initial payment around PHP 2,700 and a subsequent/second payment around PHP 1,600 (or PHP 1,400 in some threads). Typical users are principals or employers coordinating exit-related administrative charges tied to 9G case closure or return procedures. This service helps confirm the obligation, collect the minimal supporting documents, make the payment via the appropriate channel, and obtain an official receipt for the client.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to use this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal (9G holder) or an authorised local representative must be available in the Philippines to attend the payment location or to provide originals if the issuing authority requires in-person verification.
- Relationship prerequisite: The person paying should be the visa holder or the sponsoring employer/HR acting with a signed authorization linking the payment to the named applicant (passport number or case reference).
- Business prerequisite: There must be an identified reason to pay (for example an exit-related administrative tax/charge referenced by BI or a service note) and a recipient office or collection channel identified (BI, BIR, or agent cashier) before initiating payment.

Not eligible:
- Payments for which there is no definable official recipient or case reference. In those situations the client must first obtain written instruction from BI, employer HR, or the relevant authority before the agent will accept funds for payment.

## Required documents

### Must-provide by client

- Passport (copy) — used to identify the payer and cross-check the visa/case reference.
  - Type: copy × 1
  - Requirement: Clear passport bio page showing name and passport number. This is used to link the payment to the 9G case.

- Case reference / BI receipt or instruction (if available)
  - Type: copy or screenshot × 1
  - Requirement: Any BI submission receipt, SMS/chat instruction or employer note that states the payment requirement and the amount or reference code. If the client lacks a formal reference, the agent will attempt to confirm the obligation with the reporting channel before payment.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Usually same-day to 2 business days depending on authority hours and receipt issuance.

### Step 1: Intake and confirmation

**Estimated duration:** same day

**Actions:**
1. Client provides passport copy and any BI/employer instruction or chat note that mentions the payment requirement.
2. Agent confirms the payment recipient and the proper payment channel (BI cashier, BIR window, bank deposit account, or agent-managed cashier) before accepting funds.

**Required items:** passport copy, any available instruction or reference.

**Note:** If the payment is only informally mentioned in chat, the agent seeks a formal confirmation (receipt number, cashier line, or employer instruction) before proceeding.

---

### Step 2: Prepare payment and documentation

**Estimated duration:** same day

**Actions:**
1. Calculate the required amount and verify whether this is the 'first' or 'second' payment scenario referenced by the client evidence.
2. Collect funds from the client or obtain client authorisation to debit a pre-agreed account. Record payer identity and case linkage.

**Notes:** Do not proceed to pay until the recipient and amount are confirmed.

---

### Step 3: Make the payment and obtain receipt

**Estimated duration:** same day (subject to office hours)

**Actions:**
1. Pay the confirmed amount at the designated cashier or account. Prefer official channels that issue an immediate receipt.
2. Obtain an original official receipt or an electronic confirmation and scan it for the case file.
3. Issue the agent Payment Confirmation document to the client and attach the official receipt.

**Completion sign:** Official receipt in hand and confirmation delivered to client.

---

### Step 4: Follow-up (if required)

**Estimated duration:** 1–3 business days if downstream verification needed

**Actions:**
1. If BI or the employer requires proof of payment to proceed with the next immigration step (for example I-Card release or ECC), file the receipt and request processing to continue.
2. If the official recipient disputes the payment or needs additional information, assist the client to resolve via the original issuing channel.

## Price & Fees

| Effective Date | Currency | Amount | Applicable Conditions | Notes | Evidence |
| 2023-12 | PHP | 2,700 | Initial payment referenced for a 9G return-related charge | Cited as "first-time" payment amount in chat evidence | message 491018 |
| 2023-12 | PHP | 1,600 or 1,400 | Second-time or follow-up payment referenced | Chat evidence shows two alternative amounts for "second" payment | message 491020 |

**Price notes:**
- The values above are extracted from chat evidence and reflect typical agent-cited amounts; confirm the authoritative amount at intake because official recipients (BI/BIR) may publish different amounts or case-specific charges.
- Agent handling fee for payment facilitation (if charged) is quoted at intake and is separate from the official payment amount.

---

## Important notes / Risks

- Always obtain a formal receipt from the official payee. Informal transfers without a verifiable receipt are high risk and the agent will not accept them for case closure.
- If the payment is a condition for another immigration action (for example I-Card release or ECC filing), retain the receipt until the downstream authority confirms case progression.
- If the amount cannot be confirmed from an official source, the agent will not proceed and will request written confirmation from BI or the employer before payment.
