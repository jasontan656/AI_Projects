# 9G Visa Renewal Progress Inquiry

## Summary

This service checks the current processing status of a submitted 9G visa renewal application with the Philippine Bureau of Immigration (BI). Typical users are sponsored employees or their employer/agent who have already filed a renewal package and need an authoritative progress update or confirmation whether BI has approved the renewal, requested additional evidence, or is holding the file. This is a short, focused inquiry service: we use the client's submission receipt or the original 9G submission documents to query BI and deliver a concise status report with recommended next steps.

---

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to use this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: Remote inquiries are possible, but an authorized local representative or the applicant must be available in the Philippines when BI requires originals or in-person verification. Most routine status checks can be done using submission reference numbers and digital copies.
- Relationship prerequisite: The requester must be the applicant, the sponsoring employer, or an authorized representative with written authorization to obtain case information from BI.
- Business prerequisite: A 9G renewal submission must already exist in BI records (the inquiry is not a filing service). The client should provide any BI submission receipt, case reference, or the original submission documents to speed the query.

Not eligible:
- New 9G renewal filings — this service does not prepare or submit a renewal application. Use the 9G Renewal or 9G Application services for filings.
- Cases where no prior submission exists (no BI reference and no submission evidence) — an inquiry requires at least one identifier to locate the case.

## Required documents

### Documents the client must provide (cannot be produced by this service)

**9G submission receipt or 9G submission documents (original or clear scanned copies):**
- Type: original or scanned copy × 1
- Requirement: Any BI submission receipt, agent deposit slip, BI reference number, or the package of documents that was filed in BI (for example the submitted 9G application, payment evidence). The item selected should uniquely identify the case.
- How used: Used to locate and verify the case with BI. Originals are not strictly required for remote checks if the submission reference or scanned evidence is available; however, some BI counters request original receipts for in-person escalation.

**Applicant identity information:**
- Passport number, full name as on passport, date of birth — used to cross-check records if BI cannot find a match using the receipt.

---

## Documents the service can produce

**Progress Update Report (produced by this service)**
- Type: digital report (PDF/Email) × 1
- Contains: current BI status (pending / approved / needs documents / on-hold), BI reference numbers found, any BI comments or requests, recommended next steps and estimated timelines.
- Usage: Client uses the report to plan travel, collect an I-Card, provide missing evidence, or escalate the case if necessary.

---

## Outcome / Deliverables

- A short written Progress Update Report summarizing BI's response to the status inquiry.
- If BI requests additional documents or fees, a clear checklist and recommended service referrals will be provided (for example 9G Payment, 9G Order Copy Request, or I-Card release assistance).

## Process / Steps

**Estimated turnaround:** same-day to 3 business days depending on BI channel responsiveness and whether an in-person escalation is required.

### Step 1: Intake and verification

**Estimated time:** within 24 hours

**Actions:**
1. Client supplies the 9G submission receipt or scanned submission documents and applicant identity details.
2. Agent verifies receipt/reference completeness and confirms the client authorizes an inquiry on their behalf.

**Needed items:** submission receipt or scanned submission documents; passport number and applicant name.

**Notes:** If the client lacks a submission receipt, the agent will attempt a lookup using passport number and name but success depends on BI records policies.

---

### Step 2: Query BI for status

**Estimated time:** same day to 2 business days

**Actions:**
1. Agent queries BI via the appropriate channel (official BI online portal if available, BI records counter, or via official admin contact groups) using the provided reference or identity details.
2. Capture BI's official or operational response: accepted and pending, approved and awaiting card production, additional documents requested (list them), or if the case is escalated/delayed (provide reason if available).

**Completion sign:** Agent records a BI-stamped acknowledgement, email reply, or a screenshot of the official status response.

---

### Step 3: Report results and recommend next steps

**Estimated time:** same day as BI reply

**Actions:**
1. Produce the Progress Update Report and send it to the client.
2. If BI requires action (for example payment or additional documents), provide a clear checklist and link to the recommended service(s) with an estimated cost and timeline.
3. If the client requests further action (for example in-person escalation), agent will provide a quote for the additional service.

**Completion sign:** Client receives the report and confirms receipt.

## Price & Fees

| Effective Date | Currency | Amount | Applicable Conditions | Notes | Evidence |
|---------------:|:--------:|-------:|---------------------|------|---------:|
| 2024-09 | PHP | 2,500 | Standard agent inquiry fee to check a single 9G renewal case with BI | One-off fee for status check and short report; does not include any BI official fees or costs of producing missing documents. | message 567682 |

**Price notes:**
- The PHP 2,500 fee covers agent time to locate and confirm status with BI and to prepare the Progress Update Report. If the inquiry requires an in-person BI visit or protracted escalation, additional service charges will apply and will be quoted before proceeding.
- Official BI fees (for example duplicate receipt issuance, certified copies) are additional and charged by BI.

---

## Important notes & limitations

- This service is a status inquiry only. It does not modify or submit new documents unless the client requests additional filing services.
- BI response times vary; if BI requires an in-person check (for example to find a missing physical receipt), the overall turnaround time can increase.
- Provide accurate identifying details (passport number and name) to avoid delays caused by mis-matching records.

---

## Common follow-up services (if BI response requires action)

- 9G Order Copy Request (BureauOfImmigration/9g-order-copy-request.md) — when BI asks for a certified copy of the original 9G order.
- 9G Visa Payment (BureauOfImmigration/9g-visa-payment.md) — when BI requests proof of deposit or another payment to progress the file.
- 9G I-Card Release (BureauOfImmigration/9g-i-card-release.md) — when BI confirms approval and the client needs card collection.
- 9G Visa Renewal / 9G Application — if BI indicates the current filing is incomplete and a re-submission is necessary.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What information do you need to check my 9G renewal?**
You should provide the BI submission receipt or the scanned set of documents that were filed, plus your passport number and full name as printed on the passport.

**Q: How long does the inquiry take?**
A typical inquiry is completed the same day or within 1–3 business days depending on BI responsiveness. If BI requests an in-person validation of originals, the timeline lengthens.

**Q: Does this service guarantee a faster BI decision?**
No. The service only reports BI's official or operational status and advises on next steps. We can escalate where justified, but BI processing priorities are under BI control.
