# 9G I-Card Replacement

## Summary

9G I-Card Replacement is a Bureau of Immigration-related service to obtain a replacement 9G I-Card when the original card is lost. Typical clients are foreign employees holding an employer-sponsored 9G visa who have misplaced or had their I-Card stolen and need a formal replacement issued by BI. This service helps collect and verify required originals, prepare the BI submission packet for replacement, submit on behalf of the client (where BI permits representation), monitor BI processing, and coordinate secure delivery or pickup of the replacement I-Card when issued.

---

## Background prerequisites

The client must meet the following preconditions to request a 9G I-Card Replacement:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal or an authorized local representative must be in the Philippines for steps that require in-person submission or identity verification. Many BI operations demand local presence for original submission and biometrics.
- Relationship prerequisite: The applicant must be the 9G visa holder (or the employer/HR authorized to act on the employee's behalf) and should have sponsor cooperation where required.
- Business prerequisite: The client must possess a valid passport and evidence of the underlying work visa / work-permit paperwork (the "work permit paper"). BI typically requires originals as inputs for a replacement I-Card application.

Not eligible:
- Applicants located outside the Philippines who cannot provide an authorized local representative when BI mandates the principal's personal attendance and BI does not permit representation.
- Cases where the underlying visa record cannot be located in BI records and cannot be reconciled without additional retrieval or records-search processes (those require additional services such as a 9G Order Copy Request).

## Documents to prepare

### Documents the client must provide (cannot be produced by our service)

- Passport:
  - Type: original × 1
  - Requirement: Valid passport presented for identity verification. The passport will typically be borrowed by BI during processing and returned upon release.
  - How used: Identity verification and to secure the replacement endorsement.

- Work permit paper (employer / DOLE / AEP evidence):
  - Type: original × 1
  - Requirement: Original work-permit paperwork or equivalent official document that demonstrates employment basis for the 9G visa (for example the DOLE AEP card or the sponsor's work-authority documentation). The source chat refers to "工签纸原件" (original work permit paper).
  - How used: Submitted to BI as supporting evidence. Borrowed and returned when BI releases documents.

Notes: Both originals are typically required by BI and are usually borrowed during processing then returned when BI releases the new I-Card.

### Documents we can produce / assist to obtain

- Replacement application forms and submission packet
  - Producer: 9G I-Card Replacement
  - Path: BureauOfImmigration/9g-i-card-replacement.md
  - Usage: Completed BI replacement application forms, cover letter, checklist.

- If the client's 9G order or visa record cannot be found, we can coordinate a 9G Order Copy Request (related service) to retrieve the official BI record needed for the replacement.

## Outcome / Documents obtained after completion

  - Type: original × 1

  - Use: Proof of submission and reference number for progress inquiries.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Variable depending on BI workload; typically from several days to several weeks. Many replacement requests require in-person steps and BI processing time.

### Step 1: Intake and document collection

**Estimated duration:** 0.5–1 business day

Specific actions:
1. Client provides passport original and the original work permit paper (AEP or equivalent) or authorizes us to collect them for submission.
2. Agent verifies identity details, records the loss circumstances and prepares the initial replacement checklist.

**Needed documents:**
- Passport (original)
- Work permit paper (original)

**Notes:** Inform the client that BI commonly holds originals during processing and arrange secure transfer logistics (courier or in-person handover).

### Step 2: Prepare replacement application and supporting packet

**Estimated duration:** 1–3 business days

Specific actions:
1. Complete BI replacement forms and compile supporting evidence (passport, work permit paper, police report or affidavit of loss if BI requires one).
2. If required, draft an affidavit of loss or police report assistance template for the client to sign and file.
3. Obtain client approval and signature for agent representation where BI permits filing by a representative.

**Completion sign:** Submission packet is ready and client authorizes submission.

### Step 3: Submit to Bureau of Immigration and pay fees

**Estimated duration:** Same day to several days (dependent on BI queue)

Specific actions:
1. Submit the replacement packet to the relevant BI office and pay any applicable BI processing fees.
2. Obtain a BI claim stub or receipt and record the case reference.
3. Attend any required BI appointment for biometrics or identity verification (the principal may be required to attend in person).

**Completion sign:** BI issues submission receipt and confirms processing timeline.

### Step 4: Monitor processing and collect replacement I-Card

**Estimated duration:** Days to weeks depending on BI processing times

Specific actions:
1. Monitor BI status and respond promptly to any BI requests for additional documents or clarifications.
2. When BI releases the replacement I-Card, collect it and verify details (name, visa classification, card condition) before delivering to the client.
3. Deliver the I-Card and final documents to the client and close the case.

**Completion sign:** Client receives the replacement 9G I-Card and confirms receipt.

## Price & Fees

No fixed agent fee or government fee is recorded in the source evidence for this specific replacement. Official BI fees for card replacement, any penalty fees (if applicable), and agent handling fees vary by case and must be confirmed at intake.

**Price notes:**
- Agent handling fee: quoted at intake depending on scope (document drafting, police report assistance, representation).
- Official BI fees: payable to the Bureau of Immigration at the time of submission and are not included in agent quotes unless explicitly stated.

## Important notes and restrictions

### Processing limitations
- The principal (cardholder) may be required by BI to be physically present for identity verification and biometric capture. Confirm with BI whether representation is accepted for the specific replacement case.
- If the client's BI record cannot be found or the underlying visa order is missing, the replacement request may be delayed until a 9G record copy or order is retrieved.

### Document custody
- BI commonly holds originals during processing; clients should plan travel accordingly.

### Risk warnings
- If a police report or affidavit of loss is required by BI and not provided, BI may delay or deny the replacement request.
- Replacement timelines depend on BI workload and can vary significantly.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need to be in the Philippines to replace my 9G I-Card?**
A: In most cases yes. BI often requires the cardholder's presence for identity verification. If BI accepts representation, an authorized local representative may submit on the cardholder's behalf, but BI may still require the principal for biometrics or final collection.

**Q: What documents are mandatory?**
A: The two mandatory originals extracted from the source evidence are the passport original and the work permit paper original (the file noted "护照原件" and "工签纸原件"). BI may also request a police report or affidavit of loss for lost-card cases.

**Q: How long does a replacement take?**
A: Processing time varies with BI workload. Expect anywhere from several days to a few weeks in typical scenarios.
