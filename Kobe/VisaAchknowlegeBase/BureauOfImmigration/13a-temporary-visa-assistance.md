# 13A Temporary Visa Assistance

## Summary

13A Temporary Visa Assistance provides preparatory and submission guidance for clients who need help with documents and the administrative steps involved in obtaining or regularizing a temporary visa under the 13A classification. This service is aimed at principals or their authorized representatives who require help assembling required documents, completing forms, and understanding submission and follow-up procedures with the Bureau of Immigration. The service does not itself change immigration classification; it is advisory and document-preparation focused.

---

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to use this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The client or an authorized representative should be available in the Philippines when physical presence is required by the Bureau of Immigration for submission, biometrics, or other in-person steps. Remote consultation is possible for document review and advice, but final submission may require local presence.
- Relationship prerequisite: Typically the client is a holder or applicant of 13A-related status (for example spouse of a Filipino citizen) or a person seeking assistance for a 13A temporary visa application. Evidence of relationship (for example marriage certificate) may be required depending on the specific visa purpose.
- Business prerequisite: The client must have an active passport and supporting evidence of existing visa/entry stamps or prior approval basis for 13A status where applicable.

Not eligible / cannot be handled under this task:
- Services requiring legal representation to change visa classification or to litigate immigration matters (those require specialist immigration counsel)
- Cases where the client is outside the Philippines and BI requires mandatory personal appearance with no permitted representation

The following documents typically cannot be produced by this advisory service and must be provided by the client unless otherwise stated.

- Passport (original)
  - Type: original × 1
  - Requirement: Valid passport presented for verification and, if required by BI, for submission. The passport may be temporarily held by BI during processing and will be returned upon release.
  - How used: Verification and submission to Bureau of Immigration where required.

- Marriage certificate (if visa basis is marriage)
  - Type: original or certified copy × 1
  - Requirement: PSA-certified marriage certificate or locally-accepted equivalent where 13A status is based on spousal relationship.
  - How used: Evidence of relationship; used in application package.

- Current visa / entry permit evidence
  - Type: original / copy of visa page or entry stamp × 1
  - Requirement: Shows current or prior entry and visa classification relevant to the 13A application.
  - How used: Supports eligibility and application narrative.

- Any existing BI documents (I-Card, prior approvals)
  - Type: original or certified copy as available
  - Requirement: If the client already holds BI documents, provide them for cross-checking and preparation.

Notes: Specific document requirements will vary by case. If a required document is missing (for example marriage certificate not available), the assistant will identify which auxiliary services are needed to obtain those documents (for example PSA request) and recommend next steps.

## Process / Steps

Total estimated duration: Varies by case and Bureau of Immigration timeline. Advisory and document preparation can be completed within 1–5 business days; BI processing times are outside the advisor's control.

### Step 1: Intake and case assessment

Estimated duration: 0.5–1 business day (initial)

Specific actions:
1. Collect basic client information (name, passport number, contact details) and case facts (reason for 13A temporary visa assistance, current status).
2. Request and receive copies/scans of all available supporting documents from the client (passport, marriage certificate, visa pages, existing BI documents).
3. Assess background prerequisites and identify any missing documents or eligibility concerns.

Required documents:
- Passport copy
- Marriage certificate (if applicable)
- Current visa/entry evidence

Notes:
- The advisor will flag any background constraints early (for example client outside Philippines where BI requires personal appearance).

### Step 2: Document preparation and checklist creation

Estimated duration: 1–3 business days depending on completeness of client-provided files

Specific actions:
1. Prepare completed application forms and compile supporting documents into a submission packet.
2. Draft a submission cover letter and evidence checklist tailored to the client's case.
3. Provide the client with a pre-submission review and request any missing items.

Completion sign:
- Client confirms the packet is complete and authorizes submission (or arranges an authorized representative to submit if permitted).

### Step 3: Submission guidance and follow-up

Estimated duration: Dependent on BI scheduling and processing

Specific actions:
1. Advise the client or authorized representative on where and how to submit (which BI office, required copies, payment instructions).
2. If requested, coordinate or attend submission as the authorized representative (if properly authorized and permitted by BI).
3. Monitor case progress and advise the client on follow-up steps or additional evidence requests from BI.

Possible issues:
- BI requires original documents to be physically submitted and may hold originals during processing.
  - Solution: Inform client in advance and help arrange secure transmission or in-person submission.
- BI requests additional evidence after initial submission.
  - Solution: Prepare a rapid response checklist and assist the client in obtaining requested documents.

## Price & Fees

No fixed public retail price is recorded in the source evidence. Pricing for document preparation and submission guidance typically depends on scope: document drafting, pre-submission review, and whether an authorized representative is required to attend BI in person. Official BI fees are charged separately by the Bureau of Immigration and are not included unless explicitly stated.

Price notes:
- Advisory/document-preparation fees are charged per case; confirm price quote with the advisor during intake.
- Official BI fees, biometric/photograph fees, and any penalties are payable to BI at time of submission and are additional.

---

## Important notes / Restrictions

- This service is advisory and document-preparation focused; it does not itself guarantee a positive BI decision.
- Client must provide accurate and complete information; false or misleading information can result in denial or penalties by BI.
- If BI requires personal appearance for biometrics or interview, the client must be present or provide an accepted form of representation.
- Originals may be held by BI during processing; clients should be prepared for temporary surrender of documents.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Do I need to be in the Philippines to use this service?
A: Document review and advisory services can be provided remotely. However, if BI requires personal appearance for submission, biometrics, or photo capture, the client or an authorized representative (where permitted) must be physically present in the Philippines.

Q: Can this service guarantee BI approval for my 13A visa matter?
A: No. This service prepares and organizes the documentation and guides submission; final adjudication is performed by the Bureau of Immigration and cannot be guaranteed.

Q: What happens if a required document is missing (for example PSA marriage certificate)?
A: The advisor will identify which auxiliary services are needed to obtain the missing documents and will recommend next steps or referrals (for example PSA request services). These auxiliary services are separate and may incur additional fees.
