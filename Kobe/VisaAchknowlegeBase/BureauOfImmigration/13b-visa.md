# 13B Visa

## Summary

The 13B Visa is an immigration classification related service for foreign mothers who already hold an immigrant visa and who gave birth while temporarily outside the Philippines. When the newborn child enters the Philippines, the parent can apply for the child's admission and endorsement under the same immigrant basis. This service assists eligible principals to prepare required documents, submit the endorsement/application to the Bureau of Immigration (BI), follow up on processing, and receive the official endorsement or record that attaches the child to the parent's immigration status.

This solo task is aimed at foreign mothers who already possess an immigrant visa classification (for example a permanent or probationary immigrant spouse basis) and need to regularize their infant's immigration record upon return to the Philippines.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to request 13B Visa handling:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal (mother) or an authorized representative should be available in the Philippines when BI requires physical presence for submission, biometrics, or final collection. Some advisory work can be done remotely but BI submission often requires in-person attendance or a permitted authorized representative.
- Relationship prerequisite: The applicant must be a foreign mother who holds an existing immigrant visa entitlement or endorsement recognized by BI (for example, immigrant spouse classification or an existing immigrant order). The child must be the biological child of the immigrant visa holder.
- Business prerequisite: The parent must be able to present their passport, immigration visa/endorsement evidence (the immigrant visa order or 13B-equivalent endorsement), and the child's birth documentation. In many cases BI requires proof that the parent's immigrant visa/endorsement is valid and that the child is entitled to be included.

Not eligible:
- Cases where the parent does not hold any immigrant visa or BI-recognized immigrant endorsement.
- Situations where the child was adopted under conditions that require a separate adoption immigration pathway (this service addresses biological-child attachment under an existing immigrant basis only).

## Required documents (must be provided by client)

The following documents are typically required and must be provided by the client. These items cannot be produced by this service.

- Mother's passport:
  - Type: original × 1
  - Requirement: Valid passport of the immigrant mother. The passport may be temporarily held by BI during processing and will be returned upon release.
  - Use: Identity and immigration verification.

- Mother's immigrant visa / BI endorsement / immigration order:
  - Type: original or certified copy × 1
  - Requirement: Evidence of the mother's immigrant classification (visa page, BI order, I-Card if held). Must demonstrate the basis for granting immigration status.
  - Use: Establishes eligibility for child attachment under the same immigrant basis.

- Child's birth certificate (issued by competent civil authority):
  - Type: original or certified copy × 1
  - Requirement: Official birth certificate showing parentage. If the birth occurred overseas, an appropriately legalized or consular-registered birth certificate (or PSA equivalent) may be required.
  - Use: Proof of parent–child relationship and to register the child's immigration record.

- Child's passport or travel documents:
  - Type: original × 1 (if already issued)
  - Requirement: Passport or travel document for the newborn to travel/enter the Philippines; if the child enters without passport, BI may require additional documentary proof and special handling.
  - Use: Used for entry processing and endorsement.

- Marriage certificate or evidence of relationship (if applicable):
  - Type: original or certified copy × 1
  - Requirement: Where required to corroborate parentage or the basis of the immigrant visa (for example spouse-based immigrant visas), provide PSA marriage certificate or equivalent.
  - Use: Supporting evidence to link parent's immigrant basis to child's entitlement.

Notes:
- Originals are typically borrowed by BI during submission; they will be returned upon release according to BI practice.
- If any required document is missing (for example a foreign birth certificate not yet consular-registered), the client must obtain the missing document or request an auxiliary service to produce it before BI submission.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Varies by BI workload and case complexity. Typical turnaround ranges from same-day administrative acceptance to several weeks for final endorsement depending on BI queue and whether additional documents are requested.

### Step 1: Intake and document review

**Estimated duration:** 0.5–2 business days

Specific actions:
1. Collect scanned copies of all client documents for pre-check: mother's passport, immigrant visa/endorsement evidence, child's birth certificate, child's passport/travel documents, marriage certificate if applicable.
2. Assess whether foreign-issued birth documents need consular registration or legalization for BI acceptance; advise client on remediation steps if needed.
3. Provide a checklist and confirm in-person attendance or authorized representative arrangements.

**Required documents:** Mother's passport and visa evidence, child's birth certificate.

**Notes:** If a required document is missing, propose auxiliary services or consular liaison as needed.

### Step 2: Prepare submission package and submit to BI

**Estimated duration:** Hours to several business days depending on scheduling and document readiness.

Specific actions:
1. Prepare BI application package: completed forms, cover letter referencing the parent's immigrant order, supporting evidence, and required copies.
2. Arrange for in-person submission to the appropriate BI office or submit via authorized representative if BI permits.
3. Pay applicable BI processing fees and secure submission receipt.

**Completion sign:** BI issues a submission receipt or acknowledgement.

### Step 3: Monitor BI processing and respond to requests

**Estimated duration:** Variable (days to weeks)

Specific actions:
1. Monitor BI case status and respond promptly if BI requests further documentation or clarifications.
2. If BI requires the mother's or child's personal attendance for verification or biometrics, coordinate appointments and inform the client.
3. Obtain the official endorsement and collection of originals when BI releases documents.

**Possible issues:**
- BI may request additional evidence (for example further proof of parentage, consular registration of a foreign birth certificate).
  - Solution: Assist client in obtaining required documentation and re-submit promptly.
- If BI finds eligibility gaps (for example parent's immigrant endorsement not sufficient), advise on remedial pathways or refer to relevant immigration application services.

## Price & Fees

No fixed retail price is recorded in the provided source evidence. Official BI processing fees (if any) must be paid to the Bureau of Immigration at the time of filing and are additional to any agent service fee. Agent handling fee (administrative preparation, submission, follow-up, and representation if requested) should be quoted at intake after assessing case complexity and whether consular registration is required.

**Price notes:**
- The final cost depends on whether additional auxiliary services (consular registration, document legalization, passport issuance for the child) are necessary.
- Confirm the quote with the client during intake prior to commencing work.

---

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Processing limitations
- BI acceptance of application packets and representation rules vary; in many cases the principal is advised to attend in person for identity verification and final endorsement.
- If the child's birth occurred overseas and the birth certificate is not yet consular-registered or legalized, BI may delay acceptance until proper civil registration is completed.

### Time-related requirements
- Prepare the child's documents before travel or arrange for prompt consular registration on arrival to avoid delays in BI endorsement.
- BI workload and queue times can materially affect turnaround.

### Risk & caveats
- Missing or non-standard civil documents (for example unregistered foreign birth certificates) can delay or block the child's attachment; plan consular and civil registration steps early.
- If the parent's immigrant visa is under review, suspended, or otherwise not currently valid, the child's attachment may be denied or deferred until the parent's status is resolved.
