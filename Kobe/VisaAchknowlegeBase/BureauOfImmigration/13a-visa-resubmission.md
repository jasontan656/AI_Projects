# 13A Visa Resubmission

## Summary

This service assists applicants whose 13A marriage visa application or related 13A filing was rejected, denied or returned by the Bureau of Immigration (BI), and who need to re-submit a corrected or strengthened application. Typical clients are foreign spouses of Filipino citizens whose original 13A submission failed due to procedural errors (for example failure to attend a scheduled interview), missing documents, or BI requests for clarifications. The service identifies the rejection reason, gathers or corrects required materials, prepares an improved submission package, coordinates any required appointments (biometrics/interview), and files the resubmission with BI.

This is a standalone, client-facing solo task: clients may buy only the resubmission service when their original package was rejected. It is complementary to 13A Temporary Visa Assistance (document preparation) and 13A Visa Progress Inquiry (status checks).

## Background prerequisites

Customer must meet the following conditions to use this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal or an authorised local representative must be available in the Philippines when the Bureau of Immigration requires in-person steps (for example interview, biometrics, photo capture) or when originals must be produced.
- Relationship prerequisite: The applicant must be the foreign spouse of a Filipino citizen or otherwise eligible for 13A classification. This service presumes the original 13A basis is valid (for example a genuine marriage) and only the procedural submission failed.
- Business prerequisite: The client must have the original submission reference, any BI rejection or return notice, and the basic identity documents (passport, marriage certificate, previous BI receipts) to permit a targeted refile.

Not eligible:
- Cases that require legal appeals or formal litigation beyond administrative re-submission.
- Cases where the client's underlying eligibility for a 13A is absent (for example not married to a Filipino) — these cannot be cured by resubmission.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Varies with BI workload and the specific reason for the original rejection. Typical timeline: intake and document correction (1–7 business days), re-submission and BI receipt (hours to days), adjudication (variable — weeks to months depending on BI).

### Step 1: Intake and rejection reason verification

**Estimated duration:** 0.5–2 business days

Specific actions:
1. Obtain the BI rejection or return notice and confirm the stated reason(s) for rejection (for example: missed interview, missing affidavit, incomplete document authentication).
2. Confirm whether the client was required to attend BI in person and whether a new appointment is needed.

**Required documents:** BI rejection notice, original submission receipt, passport copy.

**Notes:** Do not re-file until the root cause is understood. A common reason in chat evidence is failure to attend a scheduled interview.

### Step 2: Prepare corrected package

**Estimated duration:** 1–7 business days depending on missing items and whether third-party documents (for example PSA or NBI) are required.

Specific actions:
1. Compile missing documents and obtain any required police reports, clearances or notarised affidavits.
2. Complete or correct BI forms, draft a concise cover letter addressing BI's prior comments, and assemble a checklist that highlights the changes made since the original submission.

**Completion sign:** Client authorises the corrected submission packet and provides originals for lodgement if required.

### Step 3: Re-submit to BI and coordinate attendance

**Estimated duration:** hours to a few days to secure a receipt; adjudication time is BI-dependent.

Specific actions:
1. Lodge the corrected packet with BI in person or via an authorised representative where BI permits representation. Pay any BI fees if required.
2. If BI requires the applicant for interview or biometrics, coordinate the appointment and confirm attendance.
3. Obtain a re-submission receipt and record the new BI reference.

**Completion sign:** BI issues a re-submission receipt / claim stub.

### Step 4: Monitor the refiled case and follow up

**Estimated duration:** ongoing until BI adjudication completes.

Specific actions:
1. Monitor BI status and respond rapidly to any further BI information requests.
2. Provide client updates and, if BI requests further documents, prepare and resubmit those items to avoid avoidable delays.

**Possible issues:** BI may request additional evidence or schedule an interview. If BI refuses the re-submission, escalate to a case review or confirm whether a fresh new application is necessary.

## Price & Fees

| Effective Date | Currency | Amount | Applicable Conditions | Notes | Evidence |
|---------------:|:--------:|------:|----------------------|------|---------:|
| 2024-04 | PHP | Variable | Agent handling fee for re-submission: quoted case-by-case | Fee depends on number of missing items and whether in-person representation is required; official BI fees are additional | messages 527407, 527453 |

**Price notes:**
- Re-submission charges are quoted at intake based on the scope of corrective work (document retrieval, notarisation, appointment coordination). Official BI fees (processing / card fees) are charged separately by BI.

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Processing limitations
- Resubmission cannot cure ineligible background issues (for example lack of a genuine spousal relationship). This process only addresses procedural or documentary rejection causes.
- Applicants often must attend BI in person for interviews, biometrics or interviews; representation is not always accepted by BI.

### Time-related considerations
- Act promptly after rejection: some BI case references can become stale or difficult to re-locate. Provide the rejection evidence and the original receipt without delay.

### Risk warnings
- Re-submission does not guarantee a different outcome. Make sure the corrective actions address the precise BI concerns; otherwise BI may return the package again.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: My 13A application was returned because I missed the interview. Can I just re-submit without attending?**
A: No. BI typically requires the applicant to appear for the scheduled interview or to authorise an acceptable representative if the office allows representation. Resubmission without satisfying BI attendance requirements will likely be returned again.

**Q: What documents usually cause a 13A rejection?**
A: Common issues include missing or uncertified marriage certificates, lack of BI receipt references, missing NBI clearance or proof of spouse's citizenship, and failure to attend BI appointments.

**Q: How long before I can re-submit?**
A: As soon as the missing items are collected and BI accepts representation (if needed). Some items such as PSA documents or NBI clearances take time to obtain — plan accordingly.
