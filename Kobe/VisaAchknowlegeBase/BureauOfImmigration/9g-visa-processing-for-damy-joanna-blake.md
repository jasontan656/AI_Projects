# 9G Visa Processing for Damy Joanna Blake

## Summary

This is a case-specific service entry to document the processing steps and required inputs for the 9G visa application requested for Damy Joanna Blake. The work covers preparing the required 9G application form, assembling supporting documents, submitting the package to the Bureau of Immigration (BI), and tracking the case through to delivery of the issued I-Card and passport endorsement.

This client-specific workflow relies on the general "9G Application" service (BureauOfImmigration/9g-application.md) for complete procedural rules, payment handling, biometric scheduling, and delivery logistics. Use this document to capture the exact documents provided by the client, any special instructions, and the evidence message that initiated the request.

## Background prerequisites

Clients must normally meet the general BI prerequisites for a 9G filing. For this client-specific case we record the following assumptions and preconditions (verify at intake):

- Geographic prerequisite: Applicant (or an authorized local representative) must be available in the Philippines for any steps that require in-person attendance (notably biometric capture) unless BI accepts authorized representation for specific steps.
- Relationship prerequisite: 9G is an employer-sponsored work visa in practice — confirm that Damy Joanna Blake has an employer sponsor or company support as required by BI for the particular 9G subtype being filed.
- Business prerequisite: Applicant must have a valid passport and any prerequisite permits (for example AEP if a multi-year 9G is being sought). If any of these are missing, advise the client and refer to the respective upstream services.

Not eligible under this case record:
- Requests that require litigation, legal appeals, or matters outside routine BI administrative filing. Escalate if BI identifies legal obstacles.

## Required documents (client must provide)

These items were extracted from the case source and must be provided by the client prior to filing. Confirm each item at intake and collect originals when BI requires them.

- 9G Visa Application Form
  - Type: original × 1
  - Required: Yes
  - Handling: This case record indicates the form will be collected for submission and treated as "collected and not returned" for the duration of BI processing if BI holds originals. Confirm client understanding and obtain written consent.
  - Notes: The application form must be filled out completely and accurately with the client's exact passport name and personal details.

- Passport (typical BI requirement — confirm at intake)
  - Type: original × 1
  - Required: Usually required for submission and biometric verification.
  - Handling: Passport is normally borrowed by BI during processing and returned upon release. If the client refuses to surrender the original, advise on representation limitations and potential processing impacts.

Notes: This client-specific file records only the explicit document extracted from the source (the 9G application form). Use the general 9G Application checklist to verify other supporting employer documents (AEP, employer letter, contract, photos, NBI if requested) and collect any additional items BI requires.

## Process / Steps (case-specific)

Total estimated duration: Dependent on BI workload. For scheduling and timing follow the general 9G Application procedures. The case-specific steps are:

### Step 1 — Prepare and verify the 9G application

Estimated duration: 1 business day (preparation)

Actions:
1. Obtain the completed 9G Visa Application Form from the client and verify every field against the passport data.
2. Collect any supporting employer or identity documents required by BI for this filing (confirm with the 9G Application service checklist).
3. Produce the submission packet and obtain the client's signature/authorization required for agent submission.

Documents needed:
- 9G Visa Application Form (original)
- Passport (original or copy for verification)

Notes:
- Verify that all names, passport numbers and dates match exactly to avoid BI rejection.

### Step 2 — Submit application to Bureau of Immigration

Estimated duration: Variable (BI queue dependent)

Actions:
1. Schedule or attend the BI biometric/appointment if BI requires the applicant to appear. If a deposit or payment is required before booking, confirm payment receipt (use the 9G Visa Payment service as needed).
2. Submit the packet to the designated BI office and pay official fees as required.
3. Obtain BI submission receipt and record the reference number in the case file.

Completion sign:
- BI issues an acknowledgement or claim stub and schedules any further steps (biometrics, payment confirmation or card issuance).

### Step 3 — Monitor and collect outputs

Estimated duration: Weeks (BI processing) — monitor regularly

Actions:
1. Track BI progress using the submission reference; respond to BI requests for additional evidence if requested.
2. Once BI issues the I-Card or returns the passport with endorsement, collect and deliver to the client or authorized representative.
3. Provide the client with final receipts and a short completion report.

Possible issues and mitigation:
- Missing supporting employer documents may delay filing — obtain the missing documents or refer the client to the 9G Visa Assistance service for company-document verification.
- If BI requires original receipts or previous BI references that the client cannot produce, expect additional charges (CRTV/amendment) — confirm during intake.

## Price & Conditions

No fixed agent fee is recorded in the source evidence for this specific client instruction. Confirm the service quote and any deposit/final payment schedule at intake. Official BI fees are payable separately to Bureau of Immigration.

---

## Case Notes and Special Instructions

- Ensure all information on the 9G application form is accurate and up-to-date. The source evidence contains a direct client request to process this case and does not list a full document set — perform a full intake to discover missing employer or identity documents.
- This case should be processed using the standard 9G Application workflow. Use the related general service (BureauOfImmigration/9g-application.md) for procedural reference and for payment/biometric scheduling.
