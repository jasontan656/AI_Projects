# ACR I-Card Application

## Summary

The ACR I-Card Application is the Bureau of Immigration procedure for foreign nationals to obtain an Alien Certificate of Registration (ACR) I-Card while resident in the Philippines. This card is required for foreign nationals who register with immigration and is commonly issued to long-stay visitors, work visa holders, and other non-citizen residents. Applicants typically need to apply after they have been in the Philippines for more than 59 days and must present identity documents and proof of their immigration status. The service covers document checklist verification, fee payment, submission at the BI counter, and collection of the ACR I-Card or official receipts.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to apply for an ACR I-Card:

- Geographic prerequisite: Applicant must be physically present in the Philippines for in-person submission and card collection when BI requires it.
- Relationship prerequisite: None specific beyond being the foreign national who requires registration; authorized representatives may act only where BI permits and with a signed authorization.
- Business prerequisite: Client must have a valid passport and a current visa/entry stamp. Practical rule extracted from source evidence: applicants who have lived in the Philippines for more than 59 days are expected to register for an ACR I-Card.

Not eligible:
- Persons outside the Philippines who cannot provide local representation where BI requires the principal's appearance.

## Important notes / Restrictions

- Renewal dependency: Keep your ACR I-Card safe. Evidence indicates renewal processes require the physical ACR I-Card; failure to present it at renewal may trigger re-payment of certain fees.
- Presence requirement: Applicants must usually be present in the Philippines to submit and collect the ACR I-Card unless BI explicitly permits representation for a given step.
- Document custody: BI commonly holds originals during processing. Clients should not schedule travel while originals are submitted unless they accept the risk and have contingency arrangements.
