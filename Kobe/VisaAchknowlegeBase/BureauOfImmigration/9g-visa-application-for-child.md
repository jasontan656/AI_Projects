# 9G Visa Application for Child

## Summary

This service handles the process of registering or attaching a child as a dependent to a mother's existing 9G work visa with the Bureau of Immigration (BI). Typical customers are children of foreign employees whose mother holds a valid 9G visa and who need the child's immigration record endorsed under the parent's employment-based 9G classification. The service prepares the BI submission packet, verifies required documents (mother's employment evidence and child's birth record), files with BI, monitors the case, and returns the official BI endorsement or receipt to the client.

---

## Background prerequisites

Clients must meet the following conditions to request this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The child (or an authorized representative) and the mother (or her authorized representative) should be available in the Philippines when BI requires originals or personal attendance (for example biometrics or final collection). Some preparatory work may be performed remotely.
- Relationship prerequisite: The child must be the biological dependent of the mother who holds a valid 9G classification. The mother's relationship to the child must be provable by an official birth certificate.
- Business prerequisite: The mother must hold an active and valid 9G visa/order and any employer/AEP documentation that BI often requests for employment-based dependent endorsements.

Not eligible / cannot be handled under this task:
- Cases where the mother does not hold a valid 9G visa or BI record cannot locate the mother's 9G order.
- Situations where required civil documents (for example the child's birth certificate) cannot be produced or authenticated as required by BI.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Usually several days to several weeks depending on BI workload and whether additional documents (for example certified 9G order copy) are required.

### Step 1: Intake and document verification

**Estimated duration:** 1–3 business days

1. Collect scans/photos of all documents from the mother: AEP card, I-Card, 9G order (if available), and child's birth certificate. If any document is missing, advise the client on the auxiliary service required (for example 9G Order Copy Request).
2. Verify the authenticity and completeness of documents and confirm whether BI will require the mother's personal attendance for the submission or if an authorised representative is accepted.

**Documents needed:** Mother's AEP, I-Card, 9G order (or authorization to request copy), child's birth certificate.

**Note:** If the mother's 9G order is missing, proceed to Step 1a (9G order retrieval) before filing.

---

### Step 1a (conditional): Obtain certified 9G order copy

**Estimated duration:** 2–7 business days (depending on BI records availability)

1. Use the related service 9G Order Copy Request to obtain an official copy of the mother's 9G order from BI records or the documented source.
2. When the certified copy is obtained, incorporate it into the submission packet for the dependent attachment.

**Producer:** BureauOfImmigration/9g-order-copy-request.md

### Step 2: Prepare submission packet and submit to BI

**Estimated duration:** Hours to 1–3 business days for packet preparation; BI processing time additional

1. Prepare the BI submission packet including completed forms, cover letter describing the request to attach the child, and certified copies as required.
2. Submit the packet to the appropriate BI office and pay official BI fees. Provide any signed authorizations if an agent or representative files on the mother's behalf.
3. Obtain a submission receipt and BI reference number.

**Completion sign:** BI issues a submission receipt/claim stub.

---

### Step 3: Monitor BI processing and respond to requests

**Estimated duration:** Typically 2–6 weeks but may vary

1. Monitor BI processing and respond promptly if BI requests additional documents or clarifications (for example parent attendance or additional evidence of relationship).
2. If BI schedules appointments (biometrics or verification) coordinate mother or representative attendance.
3. Once BI finalizes the endorsement, collect the child's endorsed record and return originals to the client.

**Possible issues:**
- BI may request the mother's personal appearance or additional documents — prepare to schedule attendance.
- If BI identifies problems with the mother's 9G record (expired order, AEP not found), the dependent attachment may be denied until the mother resolves her visa status.

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Processing limitations
- The mother's 9G must be valid and locatable in BI records. If the mother's 9G is probationary, expired, or under review, BI may refuse dependent attachment until the mother's status is regularized.
- BI may require the mother or the child to attend in person for identity verification, photograph, or biometrics.

### Timing requirements
- Start the process early if travel or schooling depends on the child's dependent endorsement. BI workload can prolong processing times.

### Risk warnings
- If required originals are missing or BI finds inconsistencies (for example mismatched names or unregistered birth documents), the process may be delayed or denied.
- If the mother's visa status changes (for example downgrading or cancellation), the child's attachment may be affected.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can a child be attached to a parent's 9G like a 13A dependent?**
A: Procedures differ by visa class. In the source evidence, a child dependent may be attached to a parent's 9G but BI requirements focus on the parent's valid 9G order, employment proof (AEP), and the child's birth certificate. We confirm eligibility during intake.

**Q: What if the mother's 9G order is missing?**
A: We will attempt to obtain an official certified copy through the 9G Order Copy Request service. This is a prerequisite in many cases when the original order cannot be produced.

**Q: Do I need to be in the Philippines to complete the process?**
A: Typically yes. BI often requires in-person attendance for certain verification steps. In some limited steps, an authorised representative may file on the mother's behalf if BI accepts representation.
