# APEC Visa Exit Travel Pass

## Summary

This service guides APEC Business Travel Card (ABTC/APEC) holders through the operational steps required to complete a departure "Travel Pass" or online exit declaration that is sometimes requested at the time of leaving the Philippines. It explains the common documents, the online form submission process, and practical notes for travellers and agents. The Travel Pass is typically an online form submitted via the specified government website; requirements and enforcement may vary over time and should be confirmed at intake.

---

## Background and prerequisites

Who needs this
- Holders of an APEC/ABTC order or APEC business travel entitlement who are preparing to exit the Philippines and have been instructed to complete a Travel Pass or similar online departure declaration.

Geographic prerequisite
- This is a Philippines-focused procedure: the traveller or an authorised local representative should be in the Philippines to respond to any last-minute immigration requirements. The online submission itself can normally be completed from anywhere with internet access unless the issuing authority requires local verification.

Relationship prerequisite
- None specific beyond being the traveller or an authorised person handling the traveller's exit paperwork.

Business prerequisite
- Traveller must hold an APEC order/card or be the named beneficiary of an APEC order, and must have a valid passport and travel booking when requested by the Travel Pass form or at check-in.

Not eligible / cannot be handled
- If the traveller is not an APEC order/card holder and the exit requirement is unrelated to APEC, this specific Travel Pass guidance may not apply.
- If the Travel Pass system is officially retired or not required by authorities at the time of travel, the process documented here is advisory only.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Usually a few minutes to an hour to complete the online form; follow-up depends on whether immigration or the airline requests documentary evidence at check-in.

### Step 1: Confirm whether Travel Pass is required

**Estimated duration:** 5–15 minutes

Actions:
1. Ask the traveller to provide the APEC order/card details, passport bio data and flight information.
2. Check the current official guidance (immigration website or contact) to confirm whether a Travel Pass is required for the traveller's departure date and nationality.

Notes:
- Requirements may change. If uncertain, advise the traveller to complete the Travel Pass proactively and keep a copy of the confirmation.

### Step 2: Complete the Travel Pass online

**Estimated duration:** 5–30 minutes

Actions:
1. Visit the designated Travel Pass website (use the official link provided by immigration or airline) and create or access a submission account if required.
2. Fill in the required fields using the traveller's passport details, APEC order information (if requested), flight details and any health or declaration questions asked by the form.
3. Submit the form and download or screenshot the submission confirmation or reference code.

Needed documents:
- Passport bio data (scan or physical for data entry)
- Flight booking / e-ticket

Notes:
- Preserve the confirmation (email or PDF) and present it at airline check-in or immigration if requested.

### Step 3: Present confirmation at check-in / immigration

**Estimated duration:** Varies (airport queues)

Actions:
1. At check-in and at the immigration counter, present passport, Travel Pass confirmation and flight ticket when requested.
2. If immigration or airline staff query the Travel Pass status, provide the submission reference and the agent's case note (if agent submitted on the traveller's behalf).

Completion sign:
- Airline permits boarding and immigration processes the traveller for departure without additional requirements related to Travel Pass.

## Price & Fees

No standard agent fee or government fee is recorded for the Travel Pass itself in the extracted evidence. The Travel Pass is typically a free online form administered by an authority; however, if an agent submits the Travel Pass on behalf of a traveller or provides expedited handling, an agent handling fee may be quoted at engagement.

**Price note extracted from evidence:** none recorded.

## Important notes / Risks

- The official need to complete a Travel Pass can change; always verify the current requirement before travel. Our guidance is accurate at intake but check the immigration website or airline notices close to the departure date.
- Completing a Travel Pass does not guarantee airline boarding; carriers retain the right to deny boarding for operational reasons or for document inconsistencies.
- Keep a copy of the Travel Pass confirmation (screenshot or PDF) and save the submission reference; airlines or immigration often request it at short notice.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Is the Travel Pass mandatory for APEC card holders?
A: Requirements vary by time and policy. Historically some travellers were asked to complete an exit Travel Pass; confirm with immigration or complete it proactively if unsure.

Q: Can an agent fill the Travel Pass for me?
A: Yes — with the traveller's explicit authorisation and passport details the agent can complete and submit the Travel Pass online and provide the confirmation copy.

Q: What if I already have the APEC order and the Travel Pass contradicts it?
A: Present both the APEC order and the Travel Pass confirmation to airline/immigration staff. If a formal contradiction exists, ask immigration to note the discrepancy and follow their instruction.
