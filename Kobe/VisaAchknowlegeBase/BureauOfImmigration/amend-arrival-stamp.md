# Amend Arrival Stamp

## Summary

The Amend Arrival Stamp service helps clients correct an incorrect or missing arrival/entry stamp recorded in their passport at the port of entry. This correction is often required before applying for downstream immigration procedures (for example visa extension or dependent attachment). Typical customers are foreign nationals who discovered a wrong arrival stamp (incorrect date, missing stamp, or wrong visa class) after entry and who need the official stamp corrected by the issuing immigration authority. The service coordinates the document check, liaison with the immigration stamping unit, submission of an amendment request, and collection of the corrected passport or official endorsement.

---

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to use this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal or an authorised representative must be physically available in the Philippines when the immigration stamping unit requires on-site attendance or original passport presentation. Some preparatory advisory work can be performed remotely, but correction of an arrival stamp usually requires local contact with the immigration authority or airport stamping unit.
- Relationship prerequisite: None beyond being the passport holder or an authorised representative with a signed authorisation accepted by immigration.
- Business prerequisite: Client must provide a valid passport and supporting flight/arrival details so the agent can verify the entry record and prepare the amendment request.

Not eligible:
- Persons who are outside the Philippines and cannot arrange a local authorised representative where immigration requires the passport holder's presence with no permitted representation.
- Cases that require more extensive legal or classification change (for example reissuance of a visa endorsement due to classification disputes) — those require separate visa application or amendment services.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Usually same-day to several working days depending on immigration workload and whether the passport holder must attend in person.

### Step 1: Intake and verification

**Estimated duration:** Same day (hours)

**Actions:**
1. Client submits passport scan and original flight information (itinerary or boarding pass).
2. Agent verifies the discrepancy details and confirms whether an on-site passport presentation will be necessary.

**Needed documents:**
- Passport bio page and the page with the incorrect arrival stamp
- Flight information (original or booking confirmation)

**Notes:**
- If another party claims the amendment is free, agent will still validate policies and confirm any official fees.

### Step 2: Prepare amendment request and liaise with immigration

**Estimated duration:** Same day to 1–2 business days

**Actions:**
1. Prepare the formal Amendment Request Letter attaching the flight evidence and a short explanation of the discrepancy.
2. Submit the request to the immigration stamping unit or the airport immigration desk and follow their procedural requirements (some offices accept an authorised representative on behalf of the passport holder; others require principal attendance).
3. Pay any official or administrative fees if required by immigration.

**Completion sign:** Immigration issues a submission acknowledgement or assigns a reference number for the amendment request.

### Step 3: Monitor processing and collect passport

**Estimated duration:** Hours to several days depending on immigration queue

**Actions:**
1. Monitor immigration processing and respond rapidly to any additional requests (for example original ticket presentation or identity verification).
2. Collect the passport when immigration returns it with the corrected arrival stamp, or obtain an official amendment receipt if passport is retained for a period and released later.

**Completion sign:** Passport returned with corrected arrival stamp and agent confirms amendment receipt.

## Possible issues & mitigation

- Issue: Immigration insists on principal's personal attendance and does not accept representation.
  - Mitigation: Agent will advise client to attend in person and provide a one-day appointment briefing and checklist.

- Issue: Dispute about fees — some parties claim the amendment is free while another provider estimates a fee.
  - Mitigation: Agent will verify official immigration policy and obtain a written fee estimate from the stamping unit. If a third-party claims free service, agent documents that claim and reconciles with the official BI stance.

- Issue: Passport retention by immigration for extended processing.
  - Mitigation: Agent advises client on travel contingency plans and, where permitted, arranges for temporary certified copies or a letter from immigration indicating expected release date.

## Price & Conditions

| Effective Date | Currency | Amount | Applicable Conditions | Notes | Evidence |
| 2024-08 | PHP | 10000 | Agent operational estimate covering amendment and visa extension-related handling | Evidence indicates a quoted total of PHP 10,000 for a combined amendment and visa extension package. There is a contradictory claim in chat that the amendment itself may be free; verify with immigration. | messages 549735, 549886 |

**Price notes:**
- The PHP 10,000 figure appears in chat evidence as an operational package price that includes handling the arrival-stamp amendment plus visa extension work. Always confirm the scope and whether official immigration fees are included before accepting payment.
- Some immigration offices may not charge an amendment fee; verify at intake.

---

## Attention / Restrictions

### Processing limitations
- Correcting an arrival stamp typically requires the passport holder to be present in the Philippines; remote-only cases are rare and depend on immigration acceptance of authorised representation.

### Timing requirements
- Amend the arrival stamp before attempting downstream filings (e.g., visa extension or dependent inclusion). In many cases immigration will refuse further processing until the entry record is corrected.

### Risk warnings
- Failure to correct an incorrect arrival stamp before a visa extension may lead to application rejection or further enforcement checks. Always verify and amend entry records prior to filing other immigration services.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can amendment of an arrival stamp be done for free?**
A: Policy varies by port and case. Some operational chat participants claimed the amendment can be free, while other evidence records a PHP 10,000 agent-handling/extension package. Confirm the official BI counter policy during intake.

**Q: What documents do I need to bring?**
A: At minimum: your passport (the page with the incorrect stamp) and the original flight booking/boarding pass that proves the correct arrival date and flight. Additional documents may be requested by immigration.

**Q: How long does it take?**
A: If immigration accepts the amendment request quickly, the correction can sometimes be completed same-day; in other situations it can take several working days depending on queue and verification checks.
