# ALO Repatriation

## Summary

ADO (ALO) Repatriation is an operational service that helps a person recorded with an Alien Landing Order (ALO) to arrange an organized return / repatriation from the Philippines. The service provides two tiers of operational handling: a budget option (PHP 80,000) with an extended processing timeline (approximately 3–6 months) and a premium, expedited option (PHP 450,000) that targets completion in about 2 months. The service supports clients who need an administratively managed departure plan when an ALO or immigration hold prevents normal travel or when the client requests formal repatriation assistance.

---

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to use this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal or an authorized local representative must be physically in the Philippines for in-person steps when DOLE/BI or airport authorities require original documents or attendance. Remote advisory is possible for preliminary scoping.
- Relationship prerequisite: The person must be the passport holder subject to the ALO (or a properly authorized representative acting with written authorisation accepted by the agent and authorities).
- Business prerequisite: The client should provide identifying documents (passport bio page, any BI receipts), and must acknowledge the ALO status and accept the operational risks of managed repatriation. This service does not remove the ALO record; it arranges and executes a repatriation plan.

Not eligible:
- Cases involving active criminal proceedings, formal immigration detention, or court-ordered restrictions that legally prevent departure. These cases require legal counsel and are not solvable by an operational repatriation plan alone.

---

## Required documents

### Documents the client must provide (must be provided by client)

- Passport (original and scanned copy): the passport bio page and paper/physical passport for identity verification and processing. The original may be temporarily handled by authorities; the client must accept custody handling processes.

- Proof of ALO awareness / any BI correspondence (if available): chat logs, BI claim stubs or notices that document the existence of an ALO. If the client cannot provide these, the agent will perform an ALO List Inquiry as a first step (separate service) to confirm status.

- Travel booking or ticket (when required by operator): some departure channels require a confirmed outbound ticket before the departure slot is secured. The agent will advise timing of purchase and may coordinate purchase instructions.

### Documents the service can produce

- Exit logistics package (producer: ALO Repatriation) — operational plan, airport escort instructions, and handover receipts.

- Agent-issued payment and receipt package documenting deposits and balance payments for the chosen option.

---

## Outcome / Deliverables

- Operational repatriation plan and execution: agent coordinates the departure channel, escorts, ticketing guidance and ensures the client is delivered to the airport and boarded when the channel requires in-person presence.

- Case completion confirmation: a short report and receipt showing the client departed under the arranged plan.

Note: This service arranges departure only. Permanent removal of the ALO record is a separate administrative/legal process (see ALO Lifting service).

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** depends on option chosen and operational channel availability — see Price & Fees below.

### Step 1: Intake and ALO status check

**Estimated time:** same day to 48 hours

Operations:
1. Client sends passport scan and any known BI/ALO references.
2. Agent performs a quick ALO List Inquiry (if client has not already confirmed ALO) and provides a short eligibility advisory.
3. Agent presents recommended option (budget or expedited), deposit requirement, and the expected timeline.

Needed documents: passport scan / BI receipts (if any)

Notes: If the client is not on the ALO list, the agent will recommend normal exit planning and decline the ALO Repatriation product.

---

### Step 2: Option selection and deposit

**Estimated time:** same day after intake

Operations:
1. Client selects the budget or expedited option and pays the required deposit to secure channel arrangements.
2. Agent issues deposit receipt and initiates channel reservation.

Completion sign: deposit received and channel work begins.

---

### Step 3: Operational coordination and ticketing

**Estimated time:** variable (days to weeks depending on channel and option)

Operations:
1. Agent confirms the scheduled departure window and instructs client on ticket purchase timing (the agent may ask the client to purchase or will book on behalf per agreed terms).
2. Agent coordinates escorts, airport meet-and-assist, and any required local payments at the airport.
3. If additional government or airline requirements arise, the agent obtains the documents or pays on behalf of the client per the engagement agreement.

Completion sign: agent confirms flight and airport slot, collects any balance payment if required.

---

### Step 4: Execution day — airport departure

**Estimated time:** day of departure

Operations:
1. Client arrives at the airport at the pre-agreed time; agent/escort facilitates the special channel and supports presentation to the carrier and immigration as allowed by the channel.
2. Agent documents the handover, secures boarding (when the airline accepts), and records departure confirmation.

Completion sign: client boards the aircraft and departs; agent issues case closure note.

## Price & Fees

| Effective Date | Currency | Amount | Applicable Conditions | Notes | Evidence |
|---------------:|:--------:|-------:|---------------------|------:|---------:|
| 2025-01 | PHP | 80,000 | Budget repatriation option | Processing time typically 3–6 months; lower-cost operational plan with limited escalation options | message 616928 |
| 2025-01 | PHP | 450,000 | Expedited repatriation option | Processing time approximately 2 months; includes higher-priority channel allocation and expanded operational resources | message 616928 |

Payment terms:
- A deposit is required to secure any channel reservation. Deposit amount and refund conditions are specified in the engagement agreement before any operational work begins.
- The budget option uses lower-priority channels and requires a longer lead time; the premium option uses expanded resources and higher guaranteed allocation attempts when channels are available.

Price notes:
- The agent's quoted amounts reflect operational fees and coordination costs; official government fines, airline charges, or third-party payments are extra and billed as incurred.

---

## Important notes / Risks

- Channel availability is operationally variable. The agent cannot guarantee a specific completion date; the quoted timelines are estimates based on historical channel availability and typical case complexity.
- This service does not remove or cancel the ALO record. If the client wants administrative removal of the ALO, the ALO Lifting service (separate) is the appropriate route and may take longer and require legal documentation.
- Airline boarding remains at the discretion of the carrier. The arranged channel attempts to coordinate acceptance but carriers may still deny boarding under their rules.
- Deposits may be non-refundable once operational steps have been taken (agency costs incurred). The deposit and refund policy is documented in the service engagement terms.
