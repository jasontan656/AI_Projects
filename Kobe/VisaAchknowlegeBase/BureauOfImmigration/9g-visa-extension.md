# 9G Visa Extension

## Summary

The 9G Visa Extension service helps holders of an existing 9G (employer-sponsored) visa to request an administrative extension or an amendment to their current 9G endorsement with the Philippine Bureau of Immigration (BI). Typical users are foreign employees (or their employers/HR representatives) who need to extend or correct the endorsement validity of an existing 9G record while the principal is physically in the Philippines. The service focuses on document verification, submission to BI, monitoring, payment handling, and recovery/delivery of passports and receipts. It also checks whether required receipts (for example original BI receipts) are present to avoid additional CRTV/amendment charges.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions before we can handle a 9G Visa Extension:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal or an authorised local representative must be physically present in the Philippines for any BI steps that require original document submission, biometric confirmation, or identity verification. Remote advisory is possible for document checks but final submission and release often require local presence.
- Relationship prerequisite: The applicant must be the 9G visa holder or an authorised representative acting on the visa holder's behalf. Employer/HR involvement is common because 9G is employer-sponsored.
- Business prerequisite: The client must have a traceable BI 9G order/record (or be willing to let the agent retrieve a certified copy). The passport and any original BI receipts related to the 9G filing should be available.

Not eligible:
- Cases where the client is outside the Philippines and the issuing office requires the principal to appear in person with no permitted representation.
- Situations where the 9G record is missing from BI and cannot be retrieved or reconciled without additional orders or retrieval procedures (those require separate retrieval/downgrade services).

## Required documents

### Documents the client must provide (cannot be produced by this service)

- Passport (original): original × 1
  - Requirement: Valid passport with sufficient validity and blank pages. The passport is typically borrowed by BI during processing and returned upon release.
  - Use: Identity verification and passport endorsement.

- BI submission / payment receipt(s) (original): original × 1 (if available)
  - Requirement: Any original BI receipts related to the existing 9G filing or prior payments. Evidence indicates providing the original receipt can prevent BI from charging CRTV and amendment fees again.
  - Use: To prove prior payments and to avoid duplicate charges. Borrowed and returned when BI releases the case.

- Employer sponsorship evidence (copies / originals as requested by BI): employment contract, AEP copy (if applicable), company letter of support.
  - Requirement: Documents proving the employer sponsorship if BI asks for updated sponsor evidence.
  - Use: Supporting evidence for extension or amendment requests.

Notes:
- If the client cannot produce the original BI receipt, additional charges for CRTV and amendment are likely to apply according to available evidence.
- If the client's 9G validity has already expired (example: validity recorded as up to Jan 2023), BI may impose additional fees or deny simple administrative extension; a remedial or alternative workflow may be required.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Dependent on BI workload; typically same-day to several weeks. Time varies by whether BI accepts representation, whether original receipts are provided, and whether additional evidence is required by BI.

### Step 1: Intake and document verification

**Estimated duration:** 0.5–1 business day

Specific actions:
1. Collect scans and originals required for the extension (passport, BI receipts, employer evidence).
2. Verify the presence of the original BI receipt. If the original receipt is missing, advise the client about the risk of CRTV and amendment charges.
3. Confirm BI office and appointment requirements; schedule submission if necessary.

**Documents needed:** passport (original), BI receipts (original if available), employer documents.

**Notes:** If the 9G validity on record shows expiry (for example evidence of validity until January 2023), discuss remedial options; simple extension may be impossible without extra fees or alternative procedures.

---

### Step 2: Prepare submission package and payments

**Estimated duration:** same day to 2 business days

Specific actions:
1. Prepare the BI extension/amendment application packet, including a cover letter explaining the request and attaching supporting employer evidence.
2. Calculate official BI fees and agent handling charges. If original receipts exist, prepare an evidence sheet to present to BI to avoid duplicate CRTV/amendment charges.
3. Collect client authorization and any required deposit for agent-handling and courier fees.

**Completion sign:** Client authorises submission and funds (if any) are collected.

---

### Step 3: Lodge application with Bureau of Immigration

**Estimated duration:** Variable (same day to several weeks, depending on queue)

Specific actions:
1. Submit the prepared packet and originals to the designated BI office and pay official fees. Present original BI receipt during submission to prevent duplicate charges (if available).
2. Obtain BI submission receipt / claim stub and record the reference number.
3. Monitor BI processing and respond to any BI requests for additional documents.

**Completion sign:** BI issues an acknowledgement and later returns the passport with the extension endorsement or provides formal refusal/explanatory notes.

---

### Step 4: Collect and deliver passport & final documents

**Estimated duration:** same day as BI release

Specific actions:
1. Retrieve passport and BI receipts upon release.
2. Verify the correctness of the endorsement (dates, name spelling, visa class) before delivering to the client.
3. Deliver passport and provide a short completion report with next-step recommendations (for example apply for ECC or additional BI clearances if needed).

**Completion sign:** Client receives passport with endorsed extension or an official BI explanation if extension was denied.

## Price & Conditions

No fixed universal agent fee is recorded in the source evidence for 9G Visa Extension. The following operational notes apply based on extracted chat evidence:

- If original BI receipts are not provided, BI may charge for CRTV and amendment fees; providing the original receipt prevents these duplicate charges (evidence: chat messages below).
- If the 9G visa has already expired (for example validity only until January 2023), the extension may require additional remediation and fees; confirm case-specific options at intake.

Price guidance:
- Agent handling fees and official BI fees vary by case and must be confirmed at intake.
- For amendment or special-case requests, expect BI to impose official fees in addition to the agent fee.

## Important notes and restrictions

### Processing limitations
- BI has discretion to accept, deny, or require additional evidence for any extension or amendment request; we cannot guarantee BI approval.
- If the original BI receipt is missing, BI is likely to apply CRTV/amendment charges — always attempt to provide original receipts where possible.

### Time-related considerations
- Start the extension process early and do not travel while the passport is held by BI; passport may be temporarily retained by immigration.
- If the 9G validity is already expired for a long period, the case may require more complex remediation (downgrade/cancellation or reapplication).

### Risk warnings
- Failure to provide original receipts or complete evidence can increase cost and processing time.
- Cases with enforcement flags (overstay, OTL) require specialised handling and may involve additional fees or legal steps.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need to be in the Philippines to request a 9G extension?**
A: Yes. In most cases either the principal or an authorised local representative must be physically present for original submission and collection. Some advisory steps can be completed remotely.

**Q: What happens if I do not have my original BI receipt?**
A: If the original BI receipt is not provided, BI may charge CRTV and amendment fees. Evidence from chats shows that providing the original receipt avoids these duplicate charges. If the receipt is missing, expect additional charges and longer processing times.

**Q: My 9G was valid only until January 2023 — can I still get an extension?**
A: A record showing validity until January 2023 suggests the endorsement has lapsed. Extension may be possible through remedial measures but will likely incur extra fees or require an alternative workflow. We will advise case-by-case.

## Related businesses

- 9G Application (BureauOfImmigration/9g-application.md) — reason: The 9G Application produces the original 9G order and supporting records; an extension request may reference or require the original 9G filing documents.
- 9G Order Copy Request (BureauOfImmigration/9g-order-copy-request.md) — reason: When the original 9G order or BI receipt is missing, a certified copy of the 9G order may be needed before an extension or amendment can be processed.
- 9G Downgrade and I-Card Cancellation (BureauOfImmigration/9g-downgrade-and-i-card-cancellation.md) — reason: Cases where the 9G status changes or is cancelled require coordination with downgrade and cancellation workflows; extension may not be applicable in such cases.
