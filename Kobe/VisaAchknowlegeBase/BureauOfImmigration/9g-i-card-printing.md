# 9G I-Card Printing (Main Office)

## Summary

9G I-Card Printing is a simple Bureau of Immigration operational task: printing (final production) or issuance-print processing of a 9G I-Card at the BI Main office. Typical users are holders of a successful 9G application who need the I-Card physically produced/printed and handed over. The service is performed at the BI Main office and requires an in‑office submission and a small processing fee. According to extracted operational evidence the standard handling fee at the Main office is PHP 500 per person.


## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following preconditions to request 9G I-Card printing at the Main office:

- Geographic prerequisite: The cardholder or an authorised local representative must attend in the Philippines; the print/release step is performed at BI Main and usually requires local presence.
- Relationship prerequisite: The requester must be the 9G visa beneficiary or an authorised representative with a signed authorisation accepted by BI for collection/printing where permitted.
- Business prerequisite: The 9G application must have been approved by BI and the case must be at the stage where the physical I-Card printing is available. The printing step cannot be performed prior to BI approval and scheduling.

Not eligible:
- Cases where BI has not approved the 9G application or where the I-Card is still in production queue and printing has not been scheduled.

## Required documents

### Documents the client must provide (cannot be produced by this service)

- Passport (original or clear scanned copy)
  - Type: original × 1 (present at counter when required)
  - Requirement: Valid passport used to confirm identity at the BI Main office. Present and sign where BI requires principal attendance.
  - This document is used to verify identity at the printing/release counter.

- Bureau of Immigration submission receipt / BI reference
  - Type: copy/receipt × 1
  - Requirement: The BI submission claim stub or reference number that links the printed I-Card to the approved 9G file.
  - Use: BI staff uses this reference to locate the case and trigger the printing stage.

Notes: In many operational cases BI requires the passport and the BI claim stub at collection. If the client cannot present originals, BI may refuse printing/collection or request additional verification.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Usually same-day or next business day depending on BI schedule and queue.

### Step 1: Prepare for printing at BI Main

**Estimated duration:** 5–30 minutes (preparation)

**Specific actions:**
1. Confirm BI has scheduled the I-Card for printing for the beneficiary.
2. Collect required originals: passport, BI submission receipt/reference.
3. Confirm any outstanding BI fees or internal processing requirements.

**Required documents:**
- Passport
- BI submission receipt / reference

**Notes:**
- The printing at the Main office is an operational counter action. Confirm BI opening hours and counter assignment before travel.

### Step 2: In-person submission at BI Main

**Estimated duration:** 15–60 minutes (queue dependent)

**Specific actions:**
1. Attend BI Main office with passport and BI claim stub.
2. Present documents at the printing/release counter and request the I-Card printing/hand-over action.
3. Pay the printed I-Card operational fee if required (standard operational handling fee recorded as PHP 500 per person).
4. Obtain a BI or agent-issued handover receipt confirming the printing and collection details.

**Completion sign:** Receipt and physical I-Card in hand.

### Step 3: Post-collection verification

**Estimated duration:** 5–10 minutes

**Specific actions:**
1. Verify the I-Card details (name spelling, visa class, card number) immediately upon receipt.
2. Report any discrepancies to BI staff promptly for correction.

**Possible issues:**
- Incorrect personal details on card → file immediate correction request with BI.
- Card damage or misprint → request reprint using the AEP/BI reprint or replacement workflows.

## Price & Fees

| Effective Date | Currency | Amount | Applicable Conditions | Notes | Evidence |
| -------------- | -------- | -----:| -------------------- | ----- | ------- |
| 2020-06 | PHP | 500 | Main office I-Card print fee per person | Standard operational handling fee at Main for I-Card printing; pay at counter | messages 10, 25, 57 (2020-06-17) |
| 2020-06 | PHP | 6500 | Group processing example — Main printing for 13 clients (total) | Example from chat evidence: 6500 PHP total for 13 clients (aggregated) | messages 25, 57 (2020-06-17) |

**Price notes:**
- The typical operational fee is PHP 500 per person when printing at BI Main. Historical chat evidence shows a group total of PHP 6,500 for 13 clients (demonstrating aggregation), but confirm per-person fee at time of service.
- Official BI fees (if any) are separate and may be charged by the Bureau. The PHP 500 is an operational printing/handling amount recorded in chat evidence.

---

## Important notes / Limitations

- BI Main handling: The print/release action must be performed at BI Main office according to extracted evidence; confirm the counter assignment and whether the client must queue at a specific window.
- Identity requirement: The passport must match BI records; inaccuracies in the passport name or BI file can cause production delays or reprints.
- Group processing: Agents commonly aggregate multiple clients for batch printing (evidence shows a 13-client batch). Group discounts or aggregated payments may be arranged operationally but must be documented.
