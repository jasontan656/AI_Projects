# 13A I-Card Replacement

## Summary

13A I-Card Replacement is a Bureau of Immigration service to replace an existing 13A classification identification card (I-Card) for foreign nationals associated with a 13A visa status. This service is for applicants who need to renew or replace a lost, damaged, or expired 13A I-Card. The service includes preparing required documentation, submitting the replacement request to the Bureau of Immigration, coordinating any required in-person procedures (for example biometric/photo requirements), and collecting the issued replacement card. Customers typically need to be physically present in the Philippines or available to attend an appointment if the BI requires in-person verification or photography.

---

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions before the replacement can be processed:

- Geographic prerequisite: The applicant or their authorized representative must be physically present in the Philippines. Certain steps (submission, biometrics, photograph) may require in-person attendance.
- Relationship prerequisite: The applicant must be a holder of 13A classification or eligible to hold a 13A I-Card (for example spouse of a Filipino citizen with 13A status). Proof of the relationship (marriage certificate) is typically required.
- Business prerequisite: The applicant should possess a valid passport and supporting visa/entry documentation. The existing I-Card (if available) and official marriage certificate (if applicable) are required as inputs.

Not eligible / cannot be handled under this task:
- Applicants who are outside the Philippines and cannot arrange an in-person appearance or authorized representation where BI explicitly requires personal attendance.
- Cases that require changing visa classification (for example conversion from 13A to another visa type) — those require separate procedures.

## Required documents (must be provided by client)

The following documents must be provided by the client. These documents are not produced by other services and must be available before we can file the replacement request.

- Passport:
  - Type: original × 1
  - Requirement: Valid passport presented for verification. The passport will be borrowed during processing and returned after immigration releases documents.
  - Use in this service: Borrowed and returned.

- Existing I-Card (if available):
  - Type: original × 1
  - Requirement: Original 13A I-Card if not completely lost. If lost, include a police report or affidavit of loss if available.
  - Use in this service: Borrowed and returned (unless BI retains for replacement processing as per their policy).

- Marriage certificate (PSA or local equivalent):
  - Type: original × 1
  - Requirement: Proof of relationship required for 13A status. Must be an original or certified copy acceptable to BI.
  - Use in this service: Borrowed and returned.

- Visa / Entry permit evidence:
  - Type: original × 1
  - Requirement: Current or prior visa page/entry stamp demonstrating 13A classification or the basis for the I-Card.
  - Use in this service: Borrowed and returned.

Notes:
- All originals are typically borrowed for submission to BI and will be returned after completion or release per BI procedures.
- If a document (for example marriage certificate) is not available, the client must obtain it first through the relevant service (not covered in this task) before initiating the I-Card replacement.

## Process / Steps

Total estimated duration: Variable depending on Bureau of Immigration workload and queue. Typical timelines range from same-day administrative actions up to several weeks for card production; timelines should be confirmed at submission.

Step 1: Initial consultation and document collection

Estimated duration: 1 business day (preparation)

Specific actions:
1. Client contacts the agent to request 13A I-Card replacement and provides basic details (name, passport number, reason for replacement: lost/damaged/expired).
2. Agent provides service quote and lists required documents.
3. Client supplies originals: passport, existing I-Card (if available), marriage certificate, visa/entry evidence.

Required documents for this step:
- Passport (original)
- Existing I-Card (original or police affidavit if lost)
- Marriage certificate (original/certified)
- Visa/entry stamp (original)

Notes:
- Client must be in the Philippines. If BI requires in-person attendance for photograph/biometrics, the client must attend or arrange an authorized representative where permitted.

Step 2: Prepare application and submit to Bureau of Immigration

Estimated duration: Hours to days depending on scheduling and BI availability

Specific actions:
1. Prepare BI replacement application forms and supporting documents.
2. Submit the application at the designated BI office and pay applicable BI processing fees.
3. If BI requires a photograph or biometric capture, schedule and attend the appointment as required.

Completion sign:
- BI provides a submission receipt or acknowledgment; the application is accepted for processing.

Step 3: Monitor processing and collect replacement I-Card

Estimated duration: Days to weeks depending on BI processing time

Specific actions:
1. Monitor BI processing status and follow up as needed.
2. Once BI issues the replacement card, collect the new I-Card and return originals to client if held.
3. Deliver final documents and confirm completion with the client.

Possible issues and mitigations:
- If documents are missing or BI requests additional evidence, agent will notify client and request the missing items.
- If BI requires personal appearance and the client cannot attend, evaluate whether authorized representation is acceptable and obtain proper authorization documents.

## Important notes and restrictions

Processing limitations:
- Applicant must be physically present in the Philippines, or arrange a permitted authorized representative where BI allows representation.
- If the case involves a change of immigration classification rather than a straight replacement, this task is not sufficient; separate visa classification procedures are required.

Timing requirements:
- Photographs or biometrics may be required by BI; scheduling these appointments can affect total turnaround time.
- BI processing times are outside agent control and can vary widely.

Risks:
- If the I-Card was lost, a police report or affidavit may be required by BI; failure to provide required loss documentation may delay or prevent issuance of a replacement card.
- Delays if BI requests additional verification or documentation.

Special situations:
- Lost card replacement often triggers additional BI checks; agent will advise and assist in obtaining police or affidavit documents if needed.

## Related businesses (informational)

- 1 Month Extension (BureauOfImmigration/1-month-extension.md) — reason: No direct dependency, but certain immigration workflows (for example ECC filing) have ordering requirements with extension tasks. Include only if client also needs extension or ECC filings.
- ECC Filing (BureauOfImmigration/ecc-filing.md) — reason: Separate independent immigration tasks that may follow other BI operations; not required for I-Card replacement but often relevant in broader immigration cases.
