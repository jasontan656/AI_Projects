# 9G Order Copy Request

## Summary

A 9G Order Copy Request is a short standalone service that obtains an official copy of an existing 9G immigration order (for example a BI 9G approval/order) on behalf of a client. The copy is requested from the issuing body (Bureau of Immigration), the filing agent, or an employer department that holds the original order. Clients typically request a 9G order copy for verification, downstream filings (such as downgrading, I-Card cancellation, or administrative records), travel clearance, or internal employer compliance.

This service handles intake, authorization checks, formal request submission to the document holder, proof-of-identity verification, secure receipt of the copy, quality check, and delivery to the client. The original remains with the issuing authority unless specifically released by them.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to use this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The client may be remote for the intake stage, but the service requires either the client or an authorized local representative in the Philippines if the issuing department requires in-person collection or identity verification.
- Relationship prerequisite: The requester must be the 9G holder (principal) or an authorized representative with a signed authorization; employer HR or company legal may also request copies on behalf of the employee if properly authorized.
- Business prerequisite: There must be an identifiable source for the original order (BI case file, employer HR file, or agent case file). If no source can be located, this service will escalate to a case search or advise next steps.

Not eligible:
- Requests where there is no traceable original 9G order in any records and where production of a copy is impossible.
- Requests lacking a valid client authorization when the issuing office requires the principal's authorization.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Usually same-day to 7 business days depending on where the original is located and whether the issuing office requires in-person collection.

### Step 1: Intake and authorization (Estimated duration: same day)

**Specific actions:**
1. Collect client identification (passport) and a signed authorization if a representative acts on the client's behalf.
2. Gather any case references (BI receipt number, passport number, applicant name) to locate the original order quickly.
3. Provide the client with the estimated fee and delivery options (scanned copy, physical copy, courier).

**Notes:** If the issuing office requires the principal's in-person presence, advise client and schedule attendance.

**Needed documents:**
- Client ID (passport copy)
- Signed authorization (if applicable)

### Step 2: Request submission and retrieval (Estimated duration: 1–5 business days)

**Specific actions:**
1. Prepare and submit a formal written request to the document holder (Bureau of Immigration, employer HR, or responsible agent team) with identity proof and authorization.
2. Track the request and follow up with the issuing office until the copy is located and released.
3. If the issuing office requires fees or formal applications, coordinate payment and documentation.

**Completion sign:** Issuing office confirms it has located the original and provides a certified copy or authorizes reproduction.

### Step 3: Quality check, delivery and close-out (Estimated duration: same day to 2 business days)

**Specific actions:**
1. Verify the copy for completeness: ensure the order number, dates, signatures, and stamps are present and legible.
2. Deliver the scanned copy to the client via secure channel and, if requested, send a physical copy by secure courier.
3. Retain a copy in the case file and update the client record. If originals were borrowed temporarily by the issuing office, confirm return or retention policy and advise the client.

**Completion sign:** Client acknowledges receipt; case closed.

**Possible issues and mitigations:**
- If the issuing office cannot locate the original → escalate to a case search and provide alternative documents or official annotations.
- If the issuing office will not release a copy without the principal present → schedule principal attendance or advise on notarized authorization requirements.

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Service limitations

- Some issuing offices will not release copies without the principal's signed authorization or in-person identity verification.

### Time & custody
- Processing time depends on where the original is stored. When originals are held by BI, release often follows BI internal processing timelines.
- Keep chain-of-custody records for any borrowed originals or certified copies.

### Risk warnings
- If the original order cannot be located, downstream processes may be delayed and may require alternative evidence or formal search requests.
- Misuse of copies for fraudulent purposes is illegal; maintain secure delivery and obtain client acknowledgment of receipt.
