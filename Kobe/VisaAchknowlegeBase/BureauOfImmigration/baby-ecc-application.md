# Baby ECC Application

## Summary

This service assists parents of an infant (example: a baby born to a Filipino mother and a Chinese father) to obtain an Exit Clearance Certificate (ECC) from the Bureau of Immigration. The Baby ECC Application covers document intake, submission of the ECC application on behalf of the infant, payment handling, and monitoring until the ECC is issued. Typical users are parents or authorised representatives who need a formal ECC to enable the infant to depart the Philippines or to complete downstream immigration processes.

---

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions before we can process a Baby ECC Application:

- Geographic prerequisite: The infant's parent or an authorised local representative should be available in the Philippines when original documents are required by the Bureau of Immigration. Some preparatory steps can be handled remotely (document review and checklist), but BI frequently requires local presence at certain points.
- Relationship prerequisite: The applicant must be the parent or legal guardian of the infant, or an authorised representative with a signed authorisation accepted by BI.
- Business prerequisite: Provide evidentiary documents proving the child's identity and parentage (for example birth certificate) and proof of the parent's identity. If the child's immigration status or other BI records are inconsistent, additional remedial steps (for example a 9A update or related BI checks) may be required before ECC filing.

Not eligible:
- Requests where the child’s parentage or identity cannot be proved with a civil birth record or equivalent.
- Cases requiring legal challenges or complex litigation (use ALO / ALO lifting or legal counsel where applicable).

## Required documents

### Documents the client must provide (cannot be produced by this service)

**Letter and Picture (required)**
- Type: original × 1
- Requirement: Original signed parental letter of consent and one (1) original photograph of the baby (passport-style or as specified by BI).
- How used: The original letter and photo are submitted with the ECC application. According to source evidence the business process may require collection of the original materials by BI; the material is noted as being "collected and not returned" in some operational cases. Parents should be prepared for originals to be held by BI during processing.

**Infant Birth Certificate (required)**
- Type: original / certified copy × 1
- Requirement: Official civil birth certificate that shows parentage; for foreign births, use a consular-registered or legalised birth record acceptable to BI.
- How used: Primary proof of parent–child relationship used to support ECC issuance.

**Parent's Passport (required)**
- Type: original or clear copy × 1
- Requirement: Passport of the parent submitting the application; BI uses passport to verify identity and to link the ECC request.
- How used: Identity verification; original may be required for in-person submission and may be temporarily held by BI per standard practice.

**Additional supporting documents (if applicable)**
- Child's passport (if already issued)
- Copies of any prior BI receipts or immigration documents relevant to the child or parent

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Depends on BI workload; plan for a few days to a few weeks. Start early if travel is scheduled.

### Step 1: Intake and document check

**Estimated duration:** 1 business day

Specific actions:
1. Collect scanned copies of the infant's birth certificate, the parent's passport, the parental letter and the baby's photograph.
2. Review documents for BI acceptance; identify any missing items or need for legalisation (for foreign-issued documents).
3. Provide the client with a checklist and a service quote, and confirm whether the parent will submit in person or authorise a representative.

**Required documents:** birth certificate, parental passport, signed parental letter, baby photo.

**Notes:** Confirm whether the 1 Month Extension or other BI short-term regularisation step is an operational prerequisite in the specific case. If the parent or child holds a pending short-term extension, ensure it is reported as completed before ECC filing.

---

### Step 2: Prepare ECC submission packet

**Estimated duration:** 1 business day

Specific actions:
1. Fill the ECC application form and assemble the cover letter referencing the child's identity and the travel reason.
2. Attach the certified/copy birth certificate, parental passport copy, original parental letter and baby photo (as required by BI).
3. Collect payment for BI processing fees if client asks the agent to pay on their behalf, and prepare proof of payment to append to the packet.

**Completion sign:** Packet ready and client authorises submission.

---

### Step 3: Submit to Bureau of Immigration and follow up

**Estimated duration:** Variable (days to weeks depending on BI workload)

Specific actions:
1. Lodge the packet at the appropriate BI counter or via the BI channel that the office accepts for ECC submissions.
2. Obtain the BI submission receipt / claim stub and record the BI reference.
3. Monitor the case, respond to BI queries, and provide additional documents promptly if requested.

**Completion sign:** BI issues the ECC and returns any applicable originals per their release policy.

| 2025-02 | PHP | 3,000 | Standard fee for baby ECC application | Operational fee reported in chat evidence; may include tip/additional expenses when agent arranges in-person handling | message 623483 |

**Price notes:**
- The PHP 3,000 figure is extracted from the source chat evidence (message ID recorded). Confirm the current fee and whether it represents the government BI fee, the agent handling fee, or a combined package at intake.
- If the BI requires additional payments (for example late filing or ACR fees), these are extra and will be charged separately.

---

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Processing limitations
- BI may require original documents and may hold originals during processing; clients must accept temporary custody by the issuing office.
- In some cases the BI requires that certain short-term extension steps (for example a 1 Month Extension) be reported as completed before ECC filing can proceed. Confirm sequence requirements during intake.

### Timing & travel advice
- Do not book non-refundable travel until ECC is issued and you have the original certificate in hand.
- Start the ECC process early if you have imminent travel plans.

### Risk warnings
- Submitting incomplete documents may delay ECC issuance. If BI rejects the packet due to missing items, additional time and costs will apply.
