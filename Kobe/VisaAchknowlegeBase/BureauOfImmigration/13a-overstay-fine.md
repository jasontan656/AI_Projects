# 13A Visa Overstay Fine

## Summary

This document summarizes the limited chat-evidence about penalties (government fines or administrative fees) applied when a 13A spousal visa holder is overdue in their first probationary year, specifically for a one-month overstay. The available evidence is sparse and does not record the concrete fine amount. The only clear operational instruction from the extracted chat evidence is that the client was asked to join a specific Telegram group for a detailed consultation to obtain the exact penalty figure.

This solo task is intended to capture the customer-facing information for clients who ask: "How much is the fine if my 13A visa probationary first year is overdue by one month?" It records what we know, what is unknown, and the recommended next step: consult the designated messaging group or Bureau of Immigration for an authoritative penalty amount.

---

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following preconditions before this advisory/consultation-related task can resolve the fine amount:

- Geographic prerequisite: The fine is administered by the Philippine Bureau of Immigration (BI). The client should be in the Philippines or able to access BI procedures / local representation to settle fines or penalties. If the client is outside the Philippines, they must coordinate with an authorized local representative or confirm BI remote procedures.
- Relationship prerequisite: The matter applies to holders of 13A classification (spouse of a Philippine citizen) or applicants in the probationary 13A stage.
- Business prerequisite: The client must know their current 13A status (probationary or permanent), the date of expiry, and have passport and visa/arrival stamp documentation available for reference.

Not eligible / cannot be resolved under this task:
- Cases requiring a formal legal appeal or complex immigration litigation (this task only records/clarifies penalty information based on chat evidence and referral to BI).
- Situations where BI policy is inconsistent or the fine depends on case-specific adjudication — these require direct BI confirmation.

---

## Documents / Information the client should provide (typical)

These items are typically required for any BI fine inquiry or payment. The exact list for a specific penalty should be confirmed in the Telegram group or with BI.

- Passport (copy and original for in-person BI interaction)
  - Type: original (for in-person), copy for remote inquiry
  - Purpose: identity verification and to verify visa stamps

- 13A visa / order / arrival stamp pages (copy and original where needed)
  - Type: original/copy
  - Purpose: to determine the precise visa expiry or probationary date and to calculate the overstay period

- Submission receipt or previous BI reference (if any)
  - Type: copy
  - Purpose: to link the inquiry to an existing BI file if the matter is under active case handling

Notes: The chat evidence does not explicitly list documents; the above items are recommended standard inputs for any BI penalty or overstay inquiry and will expedite the agent's ability to confirm the amount once in the group.

## Documents that can be produced by our services

- Advisory summary or case note explaining the calculated overstay duration and the recommended payment pathway (producer: 13A Visa Overstay Fine)
- If requested and where allowed: an authorization template permitting a local representative to act on the client's behalf when paying fines at BI (producer: 13A Visa Overstay Fine)

These outputs are administrative templates and do not substitute for BI receipts or official penalty notices.

---

## Outcome / Deliverables

Upon completion of a successful consultation (typically performed inside the referenced Telegram group or via direct BI enquiry), the client will receive:

- Confirmed penalty amount (PHP) for the specified overstay case and clear instructions on where/how to pay (BI cashier, online if available, or through an authorized representative).
- A short advisory listing any additional actions required (for example: apply for renewal, cancel I-Card, pay fines, obtain ECC clearance) and any likely downstream impacts on renewals or I-Card issuance.
- If we act as a representative, a documented receipt or BI acknowledgement of payment when payment is completed (official BI receipt will be produced by BI and returned to client).

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Depends on BI responsiveness and whether the client joins the recommended Telegram group. Typically: same day to a few days for confirmation of amount; payment and official receipt may take additional time.

### Step 1: Intake and case scoping

**Estimated duration:** Same day to 24 hours
1. Client provides passport number and brief description of the overstay (for example: "13A probationary year, overdue by 1 month, passport #: X").
2. Agent records the basic facts and instructs the client to join the designated Telegram group where BI-related staff or admins can confirm the precise fine.

**Required information:** passport number, date of visa expiry/entry, brief case history.

**Note:** The only direct instruction in the source evidence is to join the Telegram group for a definitive amount.

### Step 2: Group consultation / BI confirmation

**Estimated duration:** Same day to a few days
1. Inside the designated Telegram group, post case summary (passport number redacted if needed) and request the standard penalty amount for a 1-month overstay in probationary 13A first year.
2. Record the BI/admin response that contains the official or operational penalty amount and any conditional notes (for example extra administrative fee, or if the incident triggers additional processes).

**Completion sign:** Agent receives a firm penalty amount and documented guidance from group admins or BI.

### Step 3: Payment and confirmation (if client requests handling)

**Estimated duration:** Same day to several days depending on BI queue and payment channel
1. If the client requests representation, prepare authorization and attend BI or follow the prescribed payment workflow.
2. Obtain BI official receipt for payment.
3. Deliver the receipt and short advisory to the client with next-step recommendations (for example proceed to renew 13A, obtain ECC, or clear I-Card issues).

**Completion sign:** BI official receipt obtained and delivered to client.

## Price & Fees

| Effective Date | Currency | Amount | Applicable Conditions | Notes | Evidence |
| 2024-06 | PHP | Unknown | 13A visa probationary first year, overdue by one month | Exact fine amount not recorded in the chat evidence; client was instructed to join a Telegram group to obtain the figure | messages 5059363256, 540299 |

Price notes:
- The chat evidence does not record a concrete PHP amount for the 1-month overstay fine.
- Official BI fines and administrative penalties are set by BI and may vary by case; any agent handling fee for consultation or representation is additional and must be quoted at intake.

---

## Important notes and restrictions

- The authoritative source for any fine amount is the Bureau of Immigration or an official channel agreed upon by BI (for example BI cashier, official BI hotline, or verified group admin). The chat evidence only records a referral to a Telegram group for final determination.
- Payment of fines may be required before certain downstream actions (for example renewal, ECC filing, or I-Card issuance) can proceed.
- If the 13A has lapsed significantly or if there are aggravating factors (for example detention, repeated overstay, or other immigration violations), the penalty and required remediation steps may be more severe than a simple administrative fine. Such cases require direct BI handling.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: What is the fine for a one-month overstay in the 13A first year?
A: The chat evidence does not contain the numeric amount. The only procedural instruction extracted is that the client should join the specified Telegram group for exact confirmation. Contact BI or join the referenced group to obtain the official figure.

Q: Can I pay the fine remotely if I am outside the Philippines?
A: BI procedures vary. You may be able to authorize a local representative to pay on your behalf using an authorization letter and identity copies, but confirm this in the Telegram group or with BI before proceeding.

Q: Will paying the fine automatically resolve my 13A status?
A: Payment of fines addresses monetary penalties but does not itself guarantee reinstatement of visa validity. Additional BI procedural steps (for example renewal application, I-Card cancellation and reissue) may be required. Confirm the full remediation workflow in the BI confirmation.
