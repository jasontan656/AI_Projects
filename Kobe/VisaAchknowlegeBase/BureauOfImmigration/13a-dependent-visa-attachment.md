# 13A Dependent Visa Attachment (Child)

## Summary

This service helps attach a dependent child to a parent's 13A visa classification with the Bureau of Immigration (BI). Typical customers are children of foreign nationals who already hold a valid 13A classification (usually as spouse of a Filipino citizen) and who need the child's immigration record endorsed or regularized under the parent's 13A status. The service covers document checklist, packet preparation, submission to BI, follow-up, and collection of the resulting endorsement or visa record.

---

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to request this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The child (or an authorized representative) and the parent/guardian or authorized representative should be available in the Philippines when BI requires personal attendance. Many BI operations require physical presence for submission or biometrics.
- Relationship prerequisite: The applicant must be the child of a parent who holds a valid 13A classification. Proof of the parental relationship (birth certificate) and the parent's 13A status are required.
- Business prerequisite: The parent must hold an active and valid 13A visa classification (not in certain probationary states, see notes). If the parent is in probationary 13A, BI may not allow dependent attachment until permanent or permitted stage.

Not eligible / cannot be handled under this task:
- Cases where the parent does not have an active 13A classification or where BI policy explicitly disallows dependent issuance during the parent's probationary status.
- Situations where required original documents cannot be produced or authenticated as requested by BI.

## Required documents (must be provided by client)

The following documents are not produced by this service and must be supplied by the client unless noted otherwise.

- Parent's passport (original): original × 1 — used for identity verification and BI submission; the passport may be temporarily held by BI and will be returned when BI releases documents.

- Child's passport (original): original × 1 — required for the child's visa endorsement; borrowed and returned by BI upon release.

- Marriage certificate of parents (original/certified if required): original × 1 — as evidence of the parental relationship context where relevant. (Source mentions "结婚纸" and "结婚卡" as required supporting documents for parent identity/relationship.)

- Marriage card (original) or spouse identification (original): original × 1 — if available; used to corroborate parent's status (as extracted from chat evidence). If not applicable, supply equivalent documentation evidencing the parent's relationship and civil status.

- Parent's last arrival/entry stamp (original): original × 1 — evidence of parent entry history and visa status; borrowed during submission and returned.

- Child's birth certificate (original): original × 1 — core evidence of parent–child relationship; borrowed and returned.

- Any existing BI documents related to parent 13A (I-Card, approval letters): original × 1 — if available, include to support processing.

Notes: Most originals are borrowed by BI during processing and returned upon release. If any required document is missing, the client must obtain it (for example, PSA birth certificate) before submission.

- Submission package (completed BI forms, cover letter, checklist):
  - document: prepared administrative packet
  - producer: 13A Temporary Visa Assistance

## Documents obtained after completion

- BI endorsement/confirmation showing the child's record attached to the parent's 13A status (official BI record or endorsement): original or official copy — serves as the child's dependent visa evidence.

- BI submission receipt / acknowledgement: official receipt and reference for follow-up.

Retention: Keep BI receipts and the endorsed record safe for future immigration needs (annual reviews, travel, school enrollment, etc.).

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Approximately 1.5 months (about 6 weeks) from submission to completion, depending on BI workload and case complexity.

### Step 1: Document collection and case intake

**Estimated time:** 1–3 business days (depending on client readiness)

Actions:
1. Collect required originals and certified copies from the client: parent's passport, child's passport, birth certificate, marriage certificate/card, parent's last entry stamp, parent's BI documents if any.
2. Verify documents for BI acceptance and identify any missing items.
3. If missing documents are identified (for example, PSA birth certificate), advise client on how to obtain them or propose auxiliary services.

Required documents: see Required documents section.

Notes: Confirm whether the parent is within probationary 13A — if so, explain potential restriction that may prevent dependent attachment.

---

### Step 2: Prepare submission package and submit to BI

**Estimated time:** Hours to 1–3 business days to prepare and submit; attendance scheduling may vary.

Actions:
1. Prepare the BI submission packet (forms, cover letter, supporting evidence).
2. Submit the packet to the appropriate BI office and pay any official BI fees.
3. Provide authorized representation documents if an agent submits on the client’s behalf and BI accepts representation.

Completion sign: BI issues a submission receipt/acknowledgment.

---

### Step 3: Monitor BI processing and follow up

**Estimated time:** Approximately 4–6 weeks (variable)

Actions:
1. Monitor BI processing status and respond to BI requests for additional documents or clarifications.
2. Attend any required BI appointments (for parent or child) if BI requests personal appearance or biometrics.
3. Collect the endorsed record and any returned originals from BI when released.

Possible issues:
- BI requests additional evidence (for example further proof of relationship) → solution: assist client in obtaining and submitting required documents quickly.
- Parent's 13A is probationary and BI refuses dependent issuance → solution: advise client on required parent steps (for example apply for permanent 13A or wait until allowed), and provide alternative planning.

## Price & Fees

| Effective Date | Currency | Amount | Applicable Conditions | Notes | Evidence |
| 2023-04 | PHP | 55000 | Quoted agent/service price for child attaching to parent's 13A (source chat) | Agent handling fee; official BI fees not included | message 425326 |

Price notes:
- The PHP 55,000 figure appears in the chat evidence as an agent/service handling price for a child's attachment; confirm price at intake as rates may vary and official BI fees are additional.
- Official BI fees, card production fees (if any), and any penalties or additional government charges are payable separately to BI.

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Processing limitations
- Dependent attachment may not be allowed while the parent's 13A is in certain probationary stages. Evidence indicates "13a签证在试用期内可能无法挂靠" — confirm parent's 13A status before planning submission.
- BI may require the parent's physical presence and/or the child's presence for biometrics or identity verification; in many cases at least one BI visit is required.

### Timing requirements
- Expect around 1.5 months processing time in typical cases; BI workload may increase or decrease this timeline.
- Prepare originals in advance: BI frequently holds original documents during processing and returns them when the case is released.

### Risk & caveats
- If required originals are missing or disqualified, BI may reject or delay the attachment.
- If the parent's 13A is contested or under review, BI may deny dependent endorsement until parent's status is resolved.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Can a child be attached to a parent's probationary 13A?
A: Not always. Chat evidence suggests that attachment may not be allowed during the parent's probationary 13A. We will verify the parent's current 13A stage and advise on eligibility.

Q: How long does the process take?
A: The typical processing time reported in evidence is about 1.5 months (roughly six weeks), subject to BI workload and case specifics.

Q: Do I need to come to the BI office?
A: At least one visit to BI is commonly required. If BI accepts authorized representation for this particular case, an authorized representative may submit on your behalf where allowed, but personal attendance may still be required for biometrics or final collection.
