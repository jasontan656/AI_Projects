## Price & Fees

| Effective Date | Currency | Amount | Applicable Conditions | Notes | Evidence |
|----------------|----------|--------:|---------------------|-------|---------:|
| 2025-01 | PHP | 1300 | 9A extension fee recorded in chat evidence | Official payment amount for a recorded case; this service issues the receipt for that payment | message 913 |

**Price notes:**
- The PHP 1300 figure above is the recorded payment example extracted from chat evidence. This document service itself represents issuance of the proof-of-payment receipt and typically does not add an extra service fee beyond normal handling unless otherwise quoted.

## Attention / Special Conditions

- Ensure payer name is provided exactly as it should appear on the receipt; corrections after printing may require voiding the receipt and issuing a replacement.
- Maintain chain-of-custody: store the original receipt securely and provide only copies to third parties unless the payer requests the original.
- For accounting and audit purposes, attach the photographed evidence to the case record immediately.
