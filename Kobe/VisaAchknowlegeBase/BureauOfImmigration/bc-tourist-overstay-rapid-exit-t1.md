# BC Tourist Visa Overstay — Rapid Exit via T1 Airport

## Summary

A rapid departure service for clients who have overstayed a 9A tourist visa and need an immediate, organised exit from the Philippines using a special T1 airport channel. The service provides case intake, ticket coordination, airport escort (T1 channel), short-form liaison with airport/immigration contacts, and secure handover of travel documents. This option is positioned as an operational alternative to formal regularisation workflows when a client needs to depart quickly and accept operational trade-offs. Typical users: travelers physically located in the Philippines who must leave before a deadline and prefer a fast operational exit rather than completing lengthy immigration remedies on-site.

---

## Background prerequisites

Clients must meet the following conditions to use this rapid exit service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal must be physically present in the Philippines (the operation requires in-person airport attendance). Remote-only cases are not eligible.
- Relationship prerequisite: The client is the passport holder (traveler) or an authorised representative with a signed written authorisation accepted by the airport/immigration channel.
- Business prerequisite: The traveler must have a valid passport (even if visa is expired), be able to obtain or reserve a flight per agent instruction, and be willing to accept an expedited operational exit that prioritises departure over formal immigration remediation.

Not eligible:
- Cases involving active criminal proceedings, formal detention, or other judicial restrictions that legally prevent departure.
- Persons outside the Philippines who cannot attend the arranged airport slot.

---

## Documents / Information the client must provide

### Documents the client must provide (mandatory)

- Passport (original): present at intake and on the day of departure. The passport is used for identity verification and airline boarding. Original must be in the client’s possession for the airport process.

- Clear contact details and current location in the Philippines: address and reachable mobile number for real‑time coordination.

- Ticket preference and payment authorization: either the client purchases the instructed ticket when asked, or authorises the agent to purchase on their behalf (agent collects funds or uses prior deposit).

- Signed short-form authorisation (if an authorised representative acts): limited authorisation permitting the agent to coordinate ticketing and airport escort on the client’s behalf.

### Documents the service can produce or coordinate

- Flight booking and itinerary (agent-assisted) — produced by the service if agent books the ticket on the client’s instruction.

## Outcome / Deliverables

- Secure boarding and departure via the T1 rapid-exit channel (when the channel is available and airline accepts boarding).
- A short operational exit report and client receipt showing timing, payments, and chain-of-custody for any collected documents.
- If the client instructs the agent to buy tickets, a copy of the ticket and payment receipt will be delivered to the client.

Note: This service does not remove legal entries or administrative flags (for example ALO). It arranges a managed exit only; post‑departure record impacts remain subject to the immigration authority.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Typically target completion within 1–7 days, depending on channel availability and logistics.

### Step 1 — Intake and urgency assessment

**Estimated duration:** within 24 hours

1. Collect passport scan, current location, the stated deadline to depart and any prior BI chat evidence or notices the client received.
2. Assess eligibility for the T1 channel and confirm the client accepts the operational constraints and fees.
3. If eligible, request deposit to secure a channel reservation.

**Needed:** passport scan, contact phone, deposit authorization

**Note:** If the client is flagged with a more serious enforcement record (ALO, blacklist), advise that channel availability may be restricted and propose alternative administrative options (ALO Lifting or ALO Repatriation).

### Step 2 — Secure channel reservation and ticketing

**Estimated duration:** 1–3 days depending on availability

1. Use deposit to reserve a T1 channel slot with airport/operational contacts and to secure the targeted flight or instruct the client to purchase an airline ticket at a precise time.
2. Coordinate any required local fees (airport handling, escort) and confirm balance payment schedule.

**Completion sign:** Channel and flight reservation confirmed in writing; client receives itinerary.

### Step 3 — Airport execution and escort

**Estimated duration:** execution day (several hours)

1. Agent/escort meets client at agreed terminal meeting point (T1 area) and verifies identity.
2. Escort liaises with airline and immigration staff in the operational channel to expedite check-in and processing as allowed.
3. Client proceeds to boarding under the arranged channel and departs.

**Completion sign:** Client boards flight and agent obtains final departure confirmation; final receipt issued.

### Step 4 — Post-departure confirmation

**Estimated duration:** same day

1. Provide client with exit confirmation and a short closure report containing time stamps and payment reconciliation.
2. If the client requests post‑departure assistance (for example document copies to hand to foreign authorities), offer a follow-up package.

## Pricing & Conditions

| Effective Date | Currency | Amount | Applicable Conditions | Notes | Evidence |
| 2024-10 | PHP | 200,000 | One‑person rapid exit via T1 airport channel | Operational premium for fast T1 channel exit; channel availability variable and not guaranteed | messages 574521–574532 |

**Payment terms:**
- Deposit required to reserve the channel (amount agreed at intake; non-refundable once operational costs are incurred).
- Balance payable before execution or as per agent instructions when the channel is confirmed.

**Pricing notes:**
- The quoted PHP 200,000 is an extracted operational price from chat evidence (20万 PHP). Confirm and reconfirm the quote at intake because channel supply, urgency and airport charges may change the final price.
- Official government fines, immigration fees and airline surcharges are not included unless specifically arranged and billed separately.

---

## Risks & Important Notes

- Channel availability is dynamic. Reservation does not guarantee boarding if the airline or immigration rejects the arrangement; the agent will attempt alternatives, but no legal guarantee exists.
- This service prioritises rapid departure. Clients should be advised that using this channel may not rectify immigration records (fines, future re‑entry restrictions may still apply).
- Clients with severe enforcement records (blacklist, ALO) should be counselled about alternative administrative/legal remediation (ALO Lifting) prior to relying on an operational exit channel.
- Do not book non‑refundable onward travel until the ticket and channel are confirmed and the agent verifies boarding is likely.
