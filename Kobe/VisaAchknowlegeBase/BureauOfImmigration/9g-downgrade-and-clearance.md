# 9G Downgrade and Clearance (I-Card Cancellation + ECC)

## Summary

This service coordinates the administrative steps required to downgrade a 9G work visa (when employment ends or the sponsor requests closure) and to obtain immigration clearance (ECC or equivalent exit/clearance documentation) so a principal may depart or regularize status. Typical clients are employees whose employer relationship has ended, HR teams managing exits, or individuals who must cancel an active I-Card before clearance can proceed. The operation groups two sequential activities often required together: cancel the active I-Card / close the 9G record in BI, then file for the emigration/exit clearance (ECC) or receive the clearance-proof that allows the passport to be released for exit.

This combined workflow is necessary because clearance filing or exit procedures commonly require the I-Card to be cancelled or flagged as closed in the Bureau of Immigration (BI) system before ECC can be processed. The service handles document verification, BI/DOJ coordination where required, payment handling, collection of official receipts, and delivery of clearance evidence to the client.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to request this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal or an authorized local representative must be in the Philippines for any step that requires personal attendance, original submission, biometric verification, or in-person collection. Remote preparatory work can be done but the core BI/DOJ/ECC steps typically need physical presence or an accepted authorization.
- Relationship prerequisite: The requester must be the 9G visa holder (principal), employer HR acting on the principal's behalf, or an authorized representative with proper written authorization accepted by BI/DOJ.
- Business prerequisite: The client must be able to provide the passport original and evidence of the I-Card (original or copy). If the official BI 9G order is missing, a certified copy must be retrieved before downgrade/cancellation can proceed.

Not eligible:
- Cases where BI requires additional legal remediation (active enforcement flags such as OTL or blacklist) — those require legal or advanced immigration support beyond this combined administrative workflow.

## Required documents

### Documents the client must provide (cannot be produced by this service)

- Passport (original)
  - Type: original × 1
  - Requirement: Valid passport presented for verification and for submission. The passport will often be temporarily held by the immigration authority during clearance processing.
  - How used: Identity verification and as the travel document to be endorsed or released.

- I-Card (original or clear copy)
  - Type: original × 1 (or both-side copy when original not available)
  - Requirement: The active 9G I-Card or documentation showing I-Card status. When the I-Card remains active, BI requires cancellation of its active status before ECC/clearance filing in many cases.
  - How used: Shown to BI as the record to be cancelled and to reconcile the immigration file.

- (If original 9G order missing) 9G order certified copy
  - Type: certified copy × 1
  - Requirement: A certified true copy (CTC) of the 9G BI order when the original order cannot be produced.
  - How used: Used to support the cancellation and clearance filing; can be produced by the 9G Order Copy Request service.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Usually 1–2 weeks in routine cases. If records retrieval or third-party agency delays occur, timeline can extend.

### Step 1 — Intake and document check

**Estimated duration:** 0.5–1 business day

**Actions:**
1. Verify that the client has the passport and I-Card (or a certified copy of the I-Card/9G order).
2. If the 9G order is missing, initiate retrieval of a certified copy via 9G Order Copy Request.
3. Provide a written quote and obtain client authorization to proceed with BI cancellation and ECC filing.

**Required documents:** passport, I-Card (or authorization to retrieve CTC).

**Notes:** Cancellation cannot begin until BI accepts the cancellation request or the CTC is available to support the request.

---

### Step 2 — Request I-Card cancellation in BI

**Estimated duration:** Usually ~3–7 business days depending on BI queue

**Actions:**
1. Prepare and submit the I-Card cancellation packet to BI (originals as required) and pay any official BI fees. 
2. If expedited handling is requested, process agent escalation channels and record any agreed tip/expedite fee to front-line staff (note: unofficial tips may be used in practice but are discretionary and client-authorized only when documented).
3. Obtain BI acknowledgement indicating the I-Card has been cancelled in the system or a formal cancellation receipt.

**Completion sign:** BI issues a cancellation confirmation or internal system note showing I-Card status changed to 'cancelled'.

**Risks:** If BI detects pending enforcement or inconsistencies, additional remediation steps or fees may be required.

---

### Step 3 — File ECC / Clearance (or equivalent exit clearance)

**Estimated duration:** Same day to several business days after cancellation confirmation

**Actions:**
1. Submit the ECC/clearance filing to BI or the responsible unit, attaching the I-Card cancellation confirmation and passport.
2. Pay official clearance fees and follow BI instructions; collect any required BI receipts.
3. Monitor until BI issues clearance completion proof — the ECC receipt or clearance confirmation.

**Completion sign:** ECC or clearance document returned to client and passport cleared for release/exit.

---

### Step 4 — Deliver completed documents to client and case closure

**Estimated duration:** same day as release

**Actions:**
1. Deliver passport and ECC/clearance evidence to the client or authorized representative securely.
2. Provide a short completion report summarizing steps taken, receipts obtained and any outstanding recommendations.

**Completion sign:** Client acknowledges receipt of passport and clearance evidence.

## Price & Fees

| Effective Date | Currency | Amount | Applicable Conditions | Notes | Evidence |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 2022-12 | PHP | 8,710 | Package including clearance fees (PHP 5,710) + expedited I-Card cancellation (PHP 3,000) | Example operational price recorded in chat evidence; official BI fees separate | messages 319550, 321076 |

**Price explanation:**
- Extracted chat evidence shows a combined operational charge of PHP 8,710 for the clearance package: PHP 5,710 for clearance processing and PHP 3,000 for expedited/cancellation handling of an active I-Card. These figures were recorded in the source chat and should be confirmed at intake. Official BI fees and any DOJ or DOLE charges (if applicable) are in addition to the agent-handling amounts.

---

## Important notes and risks

- I-Card cancellation is normally required before ECC/exit clearance in many BI workflows. If the I-Card remains active, BI will typically refuse clearance filing until the cancellation is recorded.
- Expedited handling sometimes requires additional payments or tips to frontline channels in practice; any such discretionary payments must be expressly authorized by the client and documented in the case file.
- If the client has enforcement flags (OTL, blacklist, DERO), BI may issue an Order to Leave instead of a simple cancellation + clearance; remediation or legal counsel may be required.
- Originals (passport, I-Card) are often held temporarily by BI during processing; plan travel only after BI returns the passport or issues the clearance proof.
