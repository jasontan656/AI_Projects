# 2 Year 9G Work Visa

## Summary

The 2 Year 9G Work Visa service assists foreign nationals and their sponsoring employers to obtain a 2-year 9G work visa issued by the Philippine Bureau of Immigration. The service covers document preparation, submission to BI, biometric fingerprint scheduling and attendance, fee handling (deposit + balance), monitoring of processing, and secure return/delivery of the passport and issued 9G I-Card. Typical clients are foreign employees with a local employer sponsor who require a two-year work authorization (9G). Key operational steps include collecting the client's passport (original), arranging in-person biometric capture at BI, processing payments (deposit and final payment), and delivery of the I-Card and passport when the visa is issued.

## Background prerequisites

Clients must meet the following conditions before we can proceed with the 2 Year 9G Work Visa service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal (applicant) must be available in the Philippines for biometric/fingerprint capture at the Bureau of Immigration, or arrange an authorized representative only if BI permits representation for the biometric stage (BI normally requires the applicant for biometrics).
- Relationship prerequisite: There must be an employer sponsor or a local entity supporting the 9G application (the 9G is employer-based in practice). The employer must provide any company or employment documents required by BI.
- Business prerequisite: Client must hold a valid passport (original) with adequate validity for the application.

Not eligible / cannot be handled under this task:
- Applicants who are entirely outside the Philippines and who cannot attend biometric capture if BI requires the applicant in person.
- Cases where the sponsor/employer documents required by BI are not available or the employer refuses to sponsor the application.

---

## Required documents

### Documents the client must provide (cannot be produced by this service)

- Passport (original):
  - Type: original × 1
  - Requirement: Valid passport with sufficient validity. The passport will be temporarily held during submission/processing and will be returned after issuance/delivery.
  - How used: Identification and submission to Bureau of Immigration; fingerprint booking verification; ultimately returned to client with the visa endorsement and/or I-Card.

Notes: The source evidence explicitly lists passport original as mandatory. Other supporting employer documents (employment contract, company papers) are typically required by BI in practice but were not detailed in the extracted chat evidence; the service will request them if BI asks.

### Documents we can prepare / produce

- 9G visa application forms and submission packet:
  - Producer: 2 Year 9G Work Visa
  - Path: BureauOfImmigration/2-year-9g-work-visa.md
  - Usage: Completed submission packet for BI.

- Authorization templates (if an authorized representative is permitted to act):
  - Producer: 2 Year 9G Work Visa
  - Usage: Signed authorizations to allow representation when BI accepts it.

---

## Documents obtained after completion

- 9G Visa I-Card (I-Card):
  - Type: original × 1
  - Use: Official identification and evidence of 9G work visa entitlement; needed for downstream processes such as work permit (AEP) or other employer compliance.
  - Custody: The I-Card (and passport) will be delivered to the client once BI releases them.

- Receipt / BI acknowledgement of submission and fee payment:
  - Type: official receipt (original or copy)
  - Use: Proof of payment and submission; retain for records and potential future inquiries.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Varies with BI workload; the operational steps from intake to delivery commonly span from same-day biometrics to several weeks for visa issuance. Typical timeline: biometric appointment scheduling (1–7 days), processing (weeks depending on BI queues).

### Step 1: Intake and deposit payment

**Estimated duration:** Same day to 1 business day

Specific actions:
1. Confirm client identity and collect the passport (original) for submission processes that require document handling.
2. Issue a service quote and confirm the payment schedule with the client.
3. Collect the deposit payment (evidence in chat suggests a deposit of PHP 80,000 is commonly used) and record payment receipt.

**Required documents:**
- Passport (original)

**Notes:**
- Deposit amounts recorded in evidence vary; confirm current quote at intake.

### Step 2: Prepare submission packet and schedule biometric (fingerprint)

**Estimated duration:** 1–7 days depending on BI appointment availability

Specific actions:
1. Prepare the BI submission packet and confirm the appointment slot for biometric/fingerprint capture.
2. Notify the client of the scheduled biometric date and required arrival instructions.
3. Coordinate multiple clients if necessary (evidence indicates weekly BI fingerprint slots may be scheduled for groups, e.g. "every Wednesday").

**Required documents:**
- Passport (original)
- Any employer documents requested by BI (if applicable)

**Notes:**
- Evidence indicates biometric slots are often arranged weekly (for example every Wednesday). Always confirm the exact date and time with BI before notifying the client.

### Step 3: Biometric capture at Bureau of Immigration

**Estimated duration:** Appointment duration (minutes to an hour); travel and queue time varies

Specific actions:
1. Client attends the BI appointment to have fingerprints/biometrics recorded as instructed by BI.
2. Agent attends if authorized and if BI permits representation; otherwise client must attend in person.
3. Obtain confirmation/acknowledgement of biometric capture from BI and record any reference numbers.

**Completion sign:** BI confirms biometric registration was completed for the application.

### Step 4: Final payment and processing

**Estimated duration:** Same day to a few days after biometric step (processing time variable)

Specific actions:
1. When BI reaches the processing stage that requires final payment, collect the remaining balance from the client (evidence shows a typical balance of PHP 25,000 in cases where total cost PHP 105,000 is agreed).
2. Process payment via bank transfer or electronic payment (note: e-payments may incur a fee; one evidence line cites a 1.53% fee for electronic payments).
3. Submit proof of final payment to BI and confirm the agent monitoring plan for issuance.

**Required documents:**
- Payment proof

**Notes:**
- Payment amounts in chat records vary (some messages cite PHP 105,000 total with PHP 80,000 deposit + PHP 25,000 final; other messages show differing totals such as PHP 110,000). Confirm the official total and payment split at intake.

### Step 5: Issuance and return/delivery of passport and I-Card

**Estimated duration:** BI processing time (variable)

Specific actions:
1. Monitor BI processing and confirm issuance of the 9G I-Card and any visa endorsement in the passport.
2. Once issued, arrange secure delivery of the passport and 9G I-Card to the client (courier or in-person collection), or arrange pickup by authorized representative if permitted.
3. Deliver official receipts and confirm case closure with the client.

**Completion sign:** Client receives passport and 9G I-Card and confirms receipt.

### Document custody
- The passport is required as an original for submission and biometric verification. According to evidence the passport is borrowed during the process and returned to the client when BI releases documents.

- Fingerprint/biometric capture is mandatory at BI. Appointments must be scheduled and confirmed; evidence suggests a routine scheduling practice (for example weekly group slots).

### Payment and delivery
- The service typically requires a deposit before scheduling biometric appointment and a final balance before or after biometric capture depending on BI procedural timing.
- E-payment processing fees may apply; bank transfer or other channels may be used.

### Coordination
- Multiple clients may be coordinated for the same BI biometric day; confirm logistics and time windows to avoid scheduling conflicts.
