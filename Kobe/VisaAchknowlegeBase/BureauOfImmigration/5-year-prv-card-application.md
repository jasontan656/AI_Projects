# 5 Year PRV Card Application

## Summary

The 5 Year PRV Card Application is a service to obtain the 5-year Permanent Resident Visa (PRV) card issued in the Philippines. Typical customers are foreign nationals who hold an eligible permanent resident entitlement (PRV) or are dependents being attached to a PRV petitioner and require a 5-year printed PRV card. The service handles document intake, submission preparation, interaction with the issuing office, monitoring of production, and delivery of the issued PRV card.

This service is a standalone solo task. It is often requested by clients who already have a PRV endorsement or whose case is ready for physical card production.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions before we can proceed with this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal or an authorised local representative should be available in the Philippines if the issuing office requires personal attendance for collection or identity verification. Some document preparation can be done remotely, but card production and release commonly require local presence or accepted representation.
- Relationship prerequisite: The requester must be the PRV holder (principal) or an authorised representative acting with the holder's written authorisation when the issuing office accepts representation.
- Business prerequisite: The client must have the underlying PRV approval/endorsement and the identity documents required for card printing. If the required PRV order or endorsement is missing, the PRV Card Application cannot proceed until the order is retrieved or the endorsement is issued.

Not eligible:
- Persons with no PRV endorsement or whose PRV application has not yet been approved by the issuing authority.
- Cases requiring legal appeals or significant remediation (those require specialised case handling outside of a standard card production workflow).

## Documents to prepare

### Documents the client must provide (must be provided by client)

The following items cannot be produced by this service and must be supplied by the client.

**Passport (bio page and original):**
- Type: original × 1
- Requirement: Valid passport presented for identity verification and for submission if the issuing office requires originals. The passport is typically borrowed during processing and returned upon release.
- How used: Identity verification; may be taken by the issuing office during card production.

**Marriage Card (if this PRV is marriage-based):**
- Type: original × 1
- Requirement: Original marriage card (or spousal identity card) when required by the PRV basis.
- How used: Submitted to the issuing office during processing. Source evidence indicates these originals may be collected and not returned immediately.

**Marriage Certificate (civil registry / PSA) – copy:**
- Type: copy × 1
- Requirement: Certified copy of the marriage certificate; used to support the PRV entitlement.
- How used: Typically a copy is sufficient; the document may be borrowed for verification and returned.

Notes: If any required document is missing the client must obtain it prior to submission. The treatment of originals (borrowed and returned vs retained) depends on the issuing office practice; evidence in this case indicates passport and marriage card originals may be collected by the office.

**Actions:**
1. Collect passport (bio page) copy, originals where required, marriage card original (if applicable) and marriage certificate copy.
2. Verify that PRV endorsement exists and is in the correct status for card production. If the PRV order or endorsement is missing, advise on the procedure to retrieve or secure the endorsement first.
3. Confirm whether personal attendance is required for submission and collection; obtain signed authorisation if the client prefers to use a representative.

**Needed documents:** passport, marriage card (if required), marriage certificate copy, PRV endorsement reference.

**Notes:** Inform the client that original passport and marriage card may be collected by the issuing office and may not be returned until release.

### Step 2 — Prepare submission packet and lodge with issuing office

**Actions:**
1. Complete the official card production forms, prepare the cover letter and attach supporting copies and originals as required.
2. Submit the packet to the issuing office in person or via authorised representative when permitted by the office.
3. Pay any applicable official fees if requested. Record the submission receipt and reference number.

**Required documents:** prepared packet, passport and marriage card (originals if required), marriage certificate copy.

**Completion sign:** Filing receipt or acknowledgement issued by the issuing office.

### Step 3 — Monitoring and card production

**Estimated duration:** ~1.5 months typical (variable)

**Actions:**
1. Monitor the card production status and follow up with the issuing office as needed.
2. Respond to requests for supplemental information or further identity verification quickly to avoid delays.
3. When the card is produced, confirm the collection procedure (in-person pick up vs authorised representative vs courier delivery).

**Completion sign:** Issuing office notifies that the 5 Year PRV Card is ready for collection or dispatch.

### Step 4 — Collection and handover

**Estimated duration:** Same day to a few days depending on logistics

**Actions:**
1. Collect the printed PRV card from the issuing office or accept secure courier delivery as arranged.
2. Verify the printed details on the card (name, card validity, PRV class) and obtain the official release receipt.
3. Deliver the card and the release documentation to the client and close the case.

**Completion sign:** Client acknowledges receipt of the PRV card and the case is closed.
