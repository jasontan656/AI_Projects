# 9G Working Visa Processing

## Summary

9G Working Visa Processing is a focused operational task to prepare, assemble and file the paperwork required to process an employer-sponsored 9G work visa with the Bureau of Immigration (BI). Typical uses: when a case is already partially prepared but the team must collect a small set of outstanding documents (for example an extension or a certified true copy of an AEP), file the completed package with BI, and then monitor the case until a BI submission receipt or processing confirmation is obtained. This task is intended for internal case-handlers and agents who coordinate with the employer and BI.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to proceed with this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal or an authorised local representative should be available in the Philippines for any steps that require originals or in-person activity (notably BI biometrics or when BI insists on principal presence). Remote preparatory work is possible but BI filing and collection typically requires local presence.
- Relationship prerequisite: The case must have an employer sponsor or company supporting documents available to include in the submission packet. The sponsor must cooperate in providing employer evidence when BI requests it.
- Business prerequisite: The case must have a completed application packet (forms, employer documents) except for the specific outstanding items listed below. If additional upstream inputs are missing (for example AEP issuance), those must be produced first via the appropriate services (for example DepartmentOfLabor/AEP Application).

Not eligible:
- Cases with no sponsoring employer or where the employer refuses to provide sponsor documentation.
- Cases where BI requires a full re-application (rather than a simple filing) due to record conflicts or enforcement flags; such cases require a different workflow.

## Required documents

### Documents the client / sponsor must provide (cannot be produced by this task)

**Extension Document**
- Type: original × 1
- Requirement: The original extension document referenced in the case (for example a BI endorsement or extension certificate). This item is mandatory and must be provided before filing.
- How used: Presented to BI during submission; borrowed and returned when BI releases the case.

**Certified True Copy of AEP (Alien Employment Permit)**
- Type: copy × 1 (certified copy preferred)
- Requirement: A certified copy of the DOLE-issued AEP or a BI-acceptable certified true copy of the AEP card when the 9G filing requires AEP evidence.
- How used: Included in the BI submission packet as mandatory employer/permit evidence.

Notes: If the AEP card is not yet produced by DOLE, the AEP must be obtained first using the AEP Application service before BI filing can proceed.

### Documents our service can produce

**Lack Documents**
- Type: copy × 1
- Producer: 9G Working Visa Processing
- Path: BureauOfImmigration/9g-working-visa-processing.md
- Usage: Internal placeholder or checklist document listing currently missing items. In the current case the lack documents have been printed and filed in the local folder (operational note). This task will print or re-print the current 'lack' checklist when required.

**Submission packet and BI filing package**
- Type: administrative packet / copy
- Producer: 9G Working Visa Processing
- Path: BureauOfImmigration/9g-working-visa-processing.md
- Usage: Completed BI application forms, cover letter, supporting copies and the agent's submission checklist prepared for filing.

## Documents obtained after completion

**BI submission receipt / claim stub**
- Type: official acknowledgement / receipt (original or copy)
- Use: Proof the 9G package has been lodged with Bureau of Immigration and reference for status monitoring.

**Case tracking note (internal)**
- Type: copy (agent-produced)
- Use: Internal record of submission date, BI reference number and next action items (biometric schedule, balance payment requests). Keep in the client file.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Dependent on BI availability and the speed at which the client supplies outstanding documents. Typical durations: same-day to a few days for preparation; BI processing varies by workload.

### Step 1: Confirm case status and collect outstanding originals

**Estimated duration:** Same day to 1 business day

**Actions:**
1. Verify the internal case checklist and confirm which documents are still outstanding (per the lack documents in the case folder).
2. Request the Extension Document (original) and the Certified True Copy of the AEP from the sponsor or principal. Provide secure instructions on delivery or courier pickup.
3. Note the physical location of the paper folder (operational note: folders are in the cabinet beside ma'am Irish) and ensure the printed lack checklist is filed in the case folder.

**Needed documents:** Extension Document (original), Certified True Copy of AEP (copy)

**Completion sign:** All outstanding required originals/certified copies are in hand and checked for BI acceptance.

### Step 2: Assemble the BI submission packet and verify completeness

**Estimated duration:** Same day to 1 business day

**Actions:**
1. Combine completed 9G application forms, employer documents, passport copy, AEP copy (certified), extension document, photos and other BI-required attachments into a single submission packet.
2. Produce internal copies and the submission cover letter; prepare the agent's payment and fee summary if deposit or balance is due.
3. Run a final completeness check against BI checklist and internal intake notes.

**Completion sign:** Submission packet is ready, signed and authorised for filing.

### Step 3: File the package with Bureau of Immigration and obtain receipt

**Estimated duration:** Same day to several days (depending on BI queue)

**Actions:**
1. Submit the packet to the designated BI office or through the agreed BI channel. Present originals as required and pay official BI fees or provide payment proof.
2. Obtain the BI submission receipt / claim stub and record the BI reference number in the case file.
3. If BI requires biometric scheduling, confirm the date and ensure the principal's attendance (or acceptable representative handling per BI rules).

**Completion sign:** BI issues submission receipt and provides any immediate follow-up instructions.

### Step 4: Monitor BI processing and follow-up

**Estimated duration:** Variable (BI processing time)

**Actions:**
1. Monitor BI status via the BI reference or the internal group contacts. Use the BI receipt/claim stub to request periodic updates.
2. When BI requests final payment or additional documents, notify the client and coordinate payment or document delivery.
3. Capture and file the final BI output (endorsement, I-Card release notice) and close the task in the case management system.

**Completion sign:** Client receives BI acknowledgement, passport endorsement or I-Card release instructions and the case tracking note is updated to 'completed'.

## Price & Fees

No fixed public price is recorded for this short operational processing task. Agent handling fees, BI official fees, courier charges and DOLE publication charges (if AEP is not yet produced) are charged separately and quoted at intake.

**Price notes:**
- This task is a short case-handling job; cost is normally bundled into the broader 9G Application service price (see related businesses). Confirm at intake whether the client will be charged a separate handling fee for document collection, printing, courier or urgent BI follow-up.

---

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Processing limitations
- BI has discretion to accept or reject any filing; missing or non-certified AEP copies or lack of original receipts may trigger additional charges (CRTV/amendment) or require remedial steps.
- If the case contains enforcement flags (OTL, blacklist, DERO), the filing may be delayed or require a different workflow.

### Document custody
- BI typically holds originals while processing and returns them upon release. Clients should plan travel accordingly.

### Operational notes
- The case's paper folder is stored in the office cabinet beside ma'am Irish — verify custody before courier pickup.
