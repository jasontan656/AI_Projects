# 9G Visa Withdrawal

## Summary

This service assists applicants, employers or authorized agents to withdraw a pending 9G (employer-sponsored work visa) application with the Bureau of Immigration when the application has not proceeded to biometric fingerprinting. Withdrawal cancels the BI system record for the pending application and prevents the file from remaining in a 'pending' state. Typical users: employer HR, visa applicants who changed plans, or agents asked to stop a 9G filing prior to biometric scheduling.

---

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to request a 9G visa withdrawal:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal or an authorized local representative should be available in the Philippines when BI requires originals or an in-person authorization; many withdrawals can be initiated by an authorized agent locally.
- Relationship prerequisite: The applicant must be the 9G applicant or an authorized employer/agent acting with written authorization to cancel the BI filing.
- Business prerequisite: There must be a pending 9G application record on BI systems and the application must not have reached the biometric/fingerprint capture step.

Not eligible:
- Applications where the biometric/fingerprint step has already been completed (withdrawal may no longer be accepted; different remediation or cancellation workflow applies).
- Cases where the 9G endorsement has already been issued and produced (I-Card issued) — those require downgrading / cancellation procedures rather than a simple withdrawal.

- BI Cancellation Acknowledgement / System Update Confirmation:
  - Type: official acknowledgement / confirmation (copy)

---

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Typically same-day to a few business days depending on BI queue and whether the principal must attend.

### Step 1: Intake & case verification

**Estimated duration:** 0.5–1 business day

**Actions:**
1. Client provides the signed withdrawal application letter (or requests our draft) and any BI reference or receipt.
2. Verify the BI case is still pending and confirm biometric step has not been completed (we can perform a status check if the client lacks a receipt).
3. Confirm whether the applicant will sign in person or an authorised representative will submit.

**Needed documents:** Signed withdrawal letter, authorisation (if agent acts), BI reference (if available).

**Note:** If biometric was already completed, inform the client that a different cancellation/downgrade workflow is required and refer to related services.

---

### Step 2: Prepare and submit withdrawal to BI

**Estimated duration:** Same day to 2 business days

**Actions:**
1. Finalise the withdrawal letter and supporting packet; include the authorisation letter where applicable.
2. Submit the packet to the appropriate BI unit or inbox and request system cancellation of the pending 9G application.
3. Record the BI submission method and obtain any acknowledgement or case update from BI staff.

**Completion sign:** BI issues an internal confirmation or notes the file as withdrawn/cancelled in their system. Agent retains a copy of the acknowledgement.

---

### Step 3: Confirmation & case closure

**Estimated duration:** Same day to a few business days

**Actions:**
1. Retrieve BI cancellation acknowledgement and deliver scanned copy to client.
2. Update client records and, if requested, provide a short advisory on steps if the sponsor wants to re-file later (for example advise on re-submission timing or new documents required).

**Completion sign:** Client receives BI cancellation confirmation and case is closed.

## Price & Fees

| Effective Date | Currency | Amount | Applicable Conditions | Notes | Evidence |
|---------------:|:--------:|------:|----------------------|------:|---------:|
| 2024-02 | PHP | 2,500 | Agent handling fee to withdraw a pending 9G (not fingerprinted) | Bureau of Immigration itself typically charges no fee to withdraw; this is the agent service charge. | message 509411 |

**Price notes:**
- BI does not usually charge for a straightforward withdrawal of a pending application that has not reached biometric stage; confirm on submission.
- The PHP 2,500 fee covers drafting the letter, filing with BI, and follow-up until confirmation is received.

---

## Important notes / Restrictions

- Withdrawal is available only while the application remains in a pre-biometric status. If the biometric/fingerprint was already processed or the I-Card was produced, this withdrawal procedure will not apply and the client will be directed to alternative workflows (for example I-Card cancellation, downgrade or formal BI appeal).
- Clients should proactively request an official BI acknowledgement of cancellation. Leaving an application inactive without formal withdrawal can leave the case in a pending state and cause processing/monitoring friction later.
- If an agent acts on behalf of the applicant, BI often requires a signed authorisation; ensure the power-of-attorney or authorization letter meets BI requirements.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I withdraw after I already did my BI fingerprint (biometrics)?**
A: Usually no. Once biometrics are completed the case may already be in process and simple withdrawal may no longer be accepted. We will advise on the appropriate BI procedure in that circumstance (for example cancellation/downgrade workflows).

**Q: Is there an official BI fee to withdraw a pending 9G?**
A: In our extracted evidence the BI itself had no fee for withdrawal; the documented PHP 2,500 is an agent service charge. Always confirm with BI at the time of submission.

**Q: Who can submit the withdrawal?**
A: The applicant may submit personally or an authorised representative (employer/agent) can submit if a signed authorisation is provided and accepted by BI.
