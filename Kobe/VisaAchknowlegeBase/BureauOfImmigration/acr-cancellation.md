# ACR Cancellation

## Summary

ACR Cancellation is the administrative process to cancel an Alien Certificate of Registration (ACR) record for a foreign national who no longer requires it or whose immigration status has changed. Typical clients are foreign residents who need the ACR I‑Card or ACR registration record closed as part of visa changes, long-term exit, or record cleanup. The service assists with document preparation, submission to the Bureau of Immigration (BI), payment of any required fees, and obtaining written confirmation that the ACR has been cancelled.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to request ACR Cancellation:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal or an authorized local representative must be present in the Philippines when BI requires original documents or in-person submission. Some advisory work can be done remotely (document review, drafting), but BI actions typically require local presence.
- Relationship prerequisite: The applicant must be the holder of the ACR record (or an authorised representative with a signed authorization letter acceptable to BI).
- Business prerequisite: The client must provide identity documents that match the BI record (passport, current visa pages, ACR / I-Card if available). If required upstream records are missing, the agent will advise and may retrieve certified copies when possible.

Not eligible:
- Cases with unresolved enforcement flags (for example active OTL or blacklist) that require specialised legal remediation rather than simple cancellation.

## Required documents (client must provide)

The following items must be provided by the client and cannot be produced by the ACR cancellation service:

- Passport (original): present for verification; the passport may be temporarily held by BI for case processing and will be returned upon release.
- Current visa/entry stamp (original or copy): to confirm the migration record and identity.
- ACR I-Card (original) or ACR record reference (if available): the physical card or a clear copy helps BI locate the ACR entry; if the card is lost, provide an affidavit of loss and any relevant police report if BI requests it.

If any of the above records are missing, the client must supply them or authorize retrieval of certified copies (this may add time and cost).

## Documents we can produce

- Cancellation submission packet (completed BI forms, cover letter, checklist): producer: ACR Cancellation — used to submit the request to BI.
- Authorization letter template (if the client appoints an agent): producer: ACR Cancellation — a signed template to permit a representative to act where BI accepts representation.
- Affidavit of loss template (if the ACR card is lost): producer: ACR Cancellation — draft for client signature and notarisation if required by BI.

---

## Documents obtained after completion

- ACR Cancellation Confirmation / BI acknowledgement (original or certified copy): official BI confirmation that the ACR record has been cancelled. Keep this document for immigration record and future reference.
- Agent completion note and scanned receipts: internal copies and proof of submission, used for client record.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Typically 3–14 working days depending on BI workload, the presence of originals, and whether certified copies must be retrieved.

### Step 1: Intake and document verification

**Estimated duration:** 0.5–1 business day

Specific actions:
1. Client provides scanned copies of passport, visa pages, and the ACR I‑Card (if present) and confirms whether the physical originals can be submitted.
2. Agent checks BI requirements, drafts the cancellation cover letter, and identifies any missing documents (for example affidavit of loss).

**Needed documents:** passport copy, ACR card copy (if available)

**Notes:** If the ACR card is lost, prepare affidavit of loss and, if necessary, a police report.

---

### Step 2: Prepare cancellation packet and submit to BI

**Estimated duration:** 1–7 business days (depends on BI queue)

Specific actions:
1. Complete the BI cancellation forms, prepare the cover letter and client-signed authorization (if an agent files on client’s behalf).
2. Deliver originals to BI if required, pay any official BI fees, and obtain a BI submission receipt or claim stub.

**Completion sign:** BI issues a submission receipt and registers the cancellation request.

---

### Step 3: Monitor processing and receive confirmation

**Estimated duration:** 1–7 business days

Specific actions:
1. Agent monitors BI processing and follows up until BI issues an official cancellation confirmation.
2. When BI releases the confirmation, retrieve the original passport and any returned documents and deliver the BI acknowledgement to the client.

**Completion sign:** Client receives the official ACR cancellation confirmation.

**Possible issues:**
- Missing or inconsistent records may delay processing; retrieval of certified copies or further BI enquiries may be required.

## Price & Fees

No fixed public price was recorded in the source evidence. Official BI fees (if any) apply and are payable to the Bureau of Immigration. Agent handling fees depend on scope (document drafting, in-person submission, retrieval of records) and will be quoted at intake.

Price notes:
- If the client requests retrieval of missing certified copies or expedited BI liaison, additional fees will apply.

---

## Important notes & restrictions

- The principal or an authorized representative is normally required to appear for submission if BI demands original documents or any biometrics. Agent representation is acceptable only where BI permits it and when a valid authorization letter is provided.
- If the ACR card is lost, an affidavit of loss (and in some cases a police report) will speed BI processing — confirm BI instructions during intake.
- Cancellation of the ACR record does not in itself change visa classification. If the client also requires visa downgrading or ECC/exit clearance, additional BI procedures are necessary; the agent will advise on linked services.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Do I need to be in the Philippines to cancel my ACR?
A: Yes — BI usually requires the principal or an authorized local representative to handle original documents. Some preparatory work can be done remotely.

Q: What if my ACR card is lost? Can you cancel the record anyway?
A: Yes. Provide an affidavit of loss and any supporting police report if available. The agent will include those in the cancellation packet and follow BI guidance.

Q: How long does BI take to issue a cancellation confirmation?
A: Processing times vary by BI workload; typical cases finish within several working days but complex or missing-record cases can take longer.
