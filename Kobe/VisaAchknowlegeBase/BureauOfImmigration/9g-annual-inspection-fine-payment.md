# 9G Annual Inspection Fine Payment

## Summary

This service documents the operational steps and client obligations to pay fines related to a 9G annual inspection (annual check) at the Philippine Bureau of Immigration (BI). A holder of a 9G endorsement who is required to settle an annual inspection fine must attend the BI counter in person to complete the simple administrative steps: fill the form at the counter, have a photo taken if required, and pay the fine. Agents or intermediaries cannot submit the fine payment on the client's behalf, but the agent can arrange for a staff helper to accompany the client to the counter for a modest tip.

---

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to use this guidance or to attend BI to pay the annual inspection fine:

- Geographic prerequisite: The client must be physically present in the Philippines and able to visit the Bureau of Immigration counter in person.
- Relationship prerequisite: The client must be the holder of the 9G work visa endorsement (the principal) or an authorized representative only if BI explicitly accepts representation for that specific counter action (in practice most evidence indicates the principal must attend).
- Business prerequisite: The client should bring identity evidence that proves the 9G status (passport and the BI 9G I-Card or BI 9G order); without these documents BI may not accept the straightforward counter payment.

Not eligible:
- Persons outside the Philippines who cannot attend in person (the fine cannot be paid remotely by the agent on behalf of the principal in normal practice).

---

## Documents the client must provide

### Must provide (client-supplied originals)

- Passport (original)
  - Type: original × 1
  - Requirement: Valid passport with bio page. Used for identity verification at the BI counter.

- 9G I-Card or BI 9G order / visa endorsement (original or authoritative copy)
  - Type: original or certified copy × 1
  - Requirement: Evidence of 9G classification. BI counter agents will check this to link the payment to the correct BI record.

Notes: BI commonly requires the principal to present originals for simple counter processing. If any required original is missing, confirm with BI in advance whether an accepted copy will suffice.

### Documents produced by the BI (service output)

- Official BI receipt (original)
  - Type: official receipt × 1
  - Use: Proof of payment for the fine; retain for the client's immigration file and any future inquiries.

---

## Outcome / Deliverables

After attending the BI counter and completing the steps, the client will receive:

- An official Bureau of Immigration receipt evidencing the fine payment (original).
- Updated BI record or notation (as applicable) confirming that the inspection fine was settled.

Keep the official receipt safe; it may be requested for downstream processes or audits.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** usually same-day (a few minutes at the BI counter, subject to queue times).

### Step 1 — Prepare and attend the BI counter

**Estimated time:** same day

Specific actions:
1. Confirm BI office location and operating hours.
2. Bring the original passport and 9G I-Card (or BI order copy) to the designated BI window.
3. Prepare to fill a short counter form if requested by BI staff (BI staff will provide the form at the window).

**Needed documents:** passport, 9G I-Card / BI order.

**Notes:** Arrive early to avoid long queues; confirm whether BI accepts payment by cash or bank/e-payment at that counter.

---

### Step 2 — Counter procedures: form, photo, and payment

**Estimated time:** 5–30 minutes depending on queue and counter workload

Specific actions:
1. At the BI counter, request the annual inspection fine form and fill in the required details.
2. BI may take a quick photograph (photo station) or confirm identity using the I-Card.
3. Proceed to the cashier or BI payment window and pay the stated fine amount.
4. Obtain the official BI receipt after payment.

**Completion sign:** You receive the BI official receipt and any short confirmation or stamp linking the payment to your 9G case.

---

### Step 3 — Optional: agent-arranged helper

**Estimated time:** same day

Specific actions:
- Agents cannot perform the payment in place of the principal, but an agent may arrange a staff helper to accompany the principal to the window for physical assistance (for example language help or queue navigation). This helper is a convenience service only — BI still requires the principal to be present.

**Cost:** Tip for a staff helper is commonly requested by the helper; evidence extracted from the source indicates a standard tip of PHP 500 for staff assistance (not BI fine).

**Notes:** Tips for helpers are separate from the official fine and are paid to the helper directly. The official BI receipt does not cover such tips.

## Price & Fees

| Effective Date | Currency | Amount | Applicable Conditions | Notes | Evidence |
| -------------- | -------- | ------:| -------------------- | ----- | -------: |
| 2025-05 | PHP | 500 | Voluntary tip for staff helper assistance | This is a customary tip for an arranged helper (not an official BI fee). Official BI fine amount not recorded in source chat. | message 639032 |

**Price notes:**
- The official fine amount (the government/BI penalty) was not documented in the extracted chat evidence. Clients must confirm the exact fine at the BI counter when they attend. The PHP 500 entry in the table is the tip for arranging staff assistance and is not paid to BI.
- Any agent service fee (for arranging an assistant, providing translation or queue support) should be agreed separately with the agent and is not included in the above tip figure.

---

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Mandatory attendance
- The principal must attend in-person at BI to settle the annual inspection fine; third-party agents cannot complete the counter payment in place of the principal except where BI explicitly accepts an authorized representative for that specific transaction.

### Receipts
- Obtain and retain the official BI receipt. BI may require proof of payment for downstream processes; the receipt is the only authoritative evidence of settlement.

### Helper/assistant guidance
- If you arrange an agent helper, the agent will confirm whether that helper is a company staff member (not a BI official). Helpers commonly request a small tip (example: PHP 500). Tips are optional and paid directly to the helper; they are not part of the official BI payment.

### Risk warnings
- If the client does not present valid identity or visa evidence at the counter, BI may refuse to accept the payment or require additional documentation. Confirm required documents with BI before attending.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Can an agent pay the BI fine on my behalf?

A: No. Source evidence shows the principal must personally attend the BI counter to pay the annual inspection fine. Agents may only arrange a local helper to assist the principal; they cannot perform the payment in place of the principal unless BI explicitly accepts an authorised representative for that specific counter action.

Q: How much is the fine?

A: The specific government fine amount was not recorded in the extracted evidence. Please confirm the exact amount at the BI counter when you arrive. The PHP 500 figure cited in the evidence is a recommended tip for a helper and not the fine.

Q: What should I bring to the BI counter?

A: Bring your original passport and your 9G I-Card or the BI 9G order/endorsement. If you do not have the I-Card, bring any authoritative BI document that proves your 9G status and your passport.
