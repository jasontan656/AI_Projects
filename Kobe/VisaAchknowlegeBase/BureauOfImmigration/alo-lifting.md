# ALO Lifting

## Summary

ALO Lifting is a standalone service to obtain the administrative removal or lifting of an Alien Landing Order (ALO) placed against an individual. Typical customers are foreign nationals who were issued an ALO because their former employer (commonly a cancelled POGO / Philippine Offshore Gaming Operator) triggered immigration action. This service assesses ALO eligibility, prepares a formal lifting request with supporting evidence, coordinates with the Bureau of Immigration (BI) or relevant administrative channels, and pursues case resolution. In many cases legal counsel may be involved if the ALO is linked to enforcement or complex employer disputes.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions before proceeding with ALO Lifting:

- Geographic prerequisite: The applicant or an authorised local representative must be available in the Philippines for steps that require original documents, signatures, or in‑person submission. Some advisory work may be done remotely.
- Relationship prerequisite: The applicant must be the person subject to the ALO (the principal) or an employer/agent authorised to act with written permission.
- Business prerequisite: The applicant should provide passport identity, any BI receipts/orders, employer closure evidence (if POGO cancelled), and any documentary evidence that can rebut the grounds for the ALO (for example proof of lawful separation, settlement of obligations, proof of non-involvement in employer infractions).

Not eligible:
- Cases where the applicant cannot provide any identifying evidence and BI cannot locate a matching record.
- Cases that require formal judicial appeal or overseas legal action beyond administrative remediation — such matters will be escalated to legal counsel.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Variable. Simple administrative lifting requests may take days to a few weeks; cases requiring legal or inter-agency review may take months.

### Step 1 — Intake & case assessment

**Estimated duration:** 1–3 business days

1. Collect identity details, passport, and any BI receipts or chat evidence that reference the ALO.
2. Query internal channels and run a BI Status Check to locate the authoritative file and confirm the existence and basis of the ALO.
3. Advise the client on likely remediation paths (administrative lifting request vs lawyer-led appeal) and estimate fees and timelines.

**Needed documents:** passport, any BI receipt/reference, employer evidence if available.

**Note:** If the BI record cannot be found from the initial data, order a certified order copy or escalate to a records search as required.

### Step 2 — Evidence assembly & formal request drafting

**Estimated duration:** 2–7 business days depending on document availability

1. Assemble a cover letter explaining the grounds for lifting the ALO (for example: administrative error, settled fines, rescue of record mismatches, confirmed employer bankruptcy leading to forced separations).
2. Index and organize supporting documents and prepare a submission packet following BI/DOJ administrative expectations.
3. If legal counsel is recommended, prepare a referral and coordinate the scope of work (for example lawyer to draft legal memorandum or to appear in hearings).

**Completion sign:** Client approves the submission packet and authorizes filing.

### Step 3 — Submit to BI and follow up

**Estimated duration:** Weeks to months depending on BI workload and complexity

1. File the lifting request with the appropriate BI office or departmental contact and obtain a submission receipt and reference number.
2. Monitor the case, respond to BI requests for further evidence, and escalate if delays occur.
3. If BI requires inter-agency checks (for example involving DOJ, DOLE or other agencies), coordinate responses and supply the necessary legal or documentary clarifications.

**Completion sign:** BI issues a formal lifting confirmation or a decision that will be used for the next steps.

### Step 4 — Post-lifting actions and advice

**Estimated duration:** same day to a few days after BI confirmation

1. Deliver BI confirmation to the client. Advise on travel, re-application for any previously blocked services (for example reapply for visa stamping), and file closure steps.
2. If the ALO cannot be lifted administratively, advise on remedial options: pay outstanding fines, file appeal, or retain counsel for judicial review.

## Price & Fees

| Effective Date | Currency | Amount | Applicable Conditions | Notes | Evidence |
|---------------:|:--------:|-------:|----------------------|------:|---------:|
| 2022-11 | PHP | 50,000 | Typical agent administrative package price observed in chat evidence | One operational record of PHP 50,000 quoted for ALO lifting discussions | message 299772 |
| 2022-11 | PHP | 55,000 | Updated or alternative agent price observed in evidence | Price may vary by case complexity and need for legal counsel | message 299944 |

**Price notes:**
- The figures above are historical chat-extracted quotes and represent agent handling fees in past cases. Final fee depends on complexity, whether a certified BI order copy must be retrieved, and whether lawyer engagement is required.
- Official fees (if BI or another agency charges administrative fees) are additional.

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Administrative caveats
- An ALO is a BI administrative action. Lifting is at BI's discretion and depends on the factual record. Providing incorrect or fraudulent evidence will not succeed and may worsen enforcement outcomes.
- Cases tied to employer offences (for example cancelled POGO) may have complicating factors; clearing the ALO may require employer records or third-party confirmations.

### Time sensitivity
- Address ALO matters promptly before attempting international travel. Travel while an active ALO remains may result in boarding denial, detention or deportation.

### Legal risk
- Some ALOs arise from enforcement investigations; administrative lifting may not be feasible. In that situation, legal counsel is likely required and outcomes cannot be guaranteed.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What is an Alien Landing Order (ALO)?**
An ALO is a restrictive administrative notation that can block travel or immigration transactions. It is recorded in BI systems and may be placed for various reasons including employer-related enforcement.

**Q: Can an ALO always be lifted?**
No. Lifting depends on the reason for the ALO, the available evidence, and BI discretion. Administrative lifting is possible for errors, resolved obligations or when appropriate remedial evidence is presented. Some cases require legal appeal.

**Q: How long does ALO lifting take?**
Timing ranges widely. Simple administrative corrections can take days to weeks; complex enforcement-related matters may take months.
