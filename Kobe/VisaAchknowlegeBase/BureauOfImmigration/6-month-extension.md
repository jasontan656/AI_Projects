# 6 Month Extension

## Summary

The 6 Month Extension service handles the administrative process to extend a foreign national's legal stay in the Philippines for six months through the Bureau of Immigration. Typical users are foreigners who need a multi-month extension without changing visa category. The service includes document collection, preparation of the submission packet, payment handling, lodgement with the Bureau of Immigration, monitoring, and secure return of original documents (for example passport) when immigration releases them.

---

## Background prerequisites

- Relationship prerequisite: None beyond being the visa holder or an authorized representative acting on the visa holder's behalf.
- Business prerequisite: Client must possess a valid passport and have a current visa/arrival stamp or other immigration evidence indicating the need to extend stay.

Not eligible:

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Dependent on Bureau of Immigration workload; typically from same-day submission to several days for release, but can vary.

### Step 1: Intake and document collection

**Estimated duration:** 0.5–1 business day

Specific actions:
1. Collect client's passport (original) and any supporting immigration evidence (previous extension receipts, visa/arrival stamp).
2. Verify identity details and confirm client consents for agent submission if required.
3. Provide a service quote and obtain deposit if applicable.

**Documents needed:** Passport (original)

**Notes:** Inform client that immigration may hold originals during processing and that passport will be returned upon release.

---

### Step 2: Prepare submission package and determine fees

**Estimated duration:** Same day

Specific actions:
1. Prepare the BI submission packet (forms, cover letter, checklist) and calculate official BI fees plus agent handling charges.
2. Confirm with client whether this is a first-time or repeat extension (ACR fees may apply for first-time extensions or depending on client history).

**Completion sign:** Submission packet complete and client authorizes submission and payment.

---

### Step 3: Submit to Bureau of Immigration and follow up

**Estimated duration:** Variable (same day to several days)

Specific actions:
1. Lodge the extension packet with the Bureau of Immigration and pay official BI fees.
2. Monitor the case and follow up with BI until the extension is recorded and documents are released.
3. Retrieve passport and official confirmation from BI and deliver them to the client.

**Completion sign:** Passport and extension confirmation returned to client.

**Possible issues & mitigations:**
- Issue: BI requests additional documents or evidence.
  - Mitigation: Notify client immediately, obtain and submit requested items.
- Issue: Immigration holds passport for an extended time due to queue or verification.
  - Mitigation: Keep client informed and provide a timeline estimate; expedite follow-up where possible.

## Important notes / Risks

### Processing limitations
- The principal or an authorized representative must usually be in the Philippines for key steps; BI may require in-person attendance for identity verification.
- If the client's immigration history triggers issues (for example prior overstays, missing ACR records), additional fees or remedial steps may be required.

### Time requirements
- Start the extension application early to avoid unlawful gaps in legal stay. Processing times depend on BI workload and may be longer than initial estimates.

### Risk warnings
- Immigration may hold original documents (passport) during processing; temporary surrender is normal practice.
- Additional ACR or penalty fees may apply for some clients (for example first-time ACR issuance or prior irregularities).
