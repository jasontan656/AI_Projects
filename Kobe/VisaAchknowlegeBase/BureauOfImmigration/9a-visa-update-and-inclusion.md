# 9A Visa Update and Inclusion

## Summary

This service assesses and executes the necessary immigration steps to update a child's 9A tourist record (if required) and to include the child as a dependent under a parent's 13A marriage visa. Typical users are parents whose child was born in 2021 (or any year) and who now need to attach the child to the father's newly granted marriage visa. The service provides an immigration enquiry to confirm BI requirements, prepares and files a 9A update or extension when necessary, and prepares the dependent inclusion submission that attaches the child to the parent's 13A. It also advises on exit/travel risks — there is evidence of a penalty risk if the child's 9A is not updated prior to leaving the country.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to use this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The applicant (child) or an authorized local representative should be available in the Philippines when the Bureau of Immigration (BI) requires originals, personal attendance for biometrics, or in-person submission. Many BI steps require local presence.
- Relationship prerequisite: The parent (petitioner) must hold a valid 13A marriage visa or be in the process of securing it (the usual basis for dependent attachment).
- Business prerequisite: The client must be able to provide the child's civil birth evidence and the parent's marriage evidence as core inputs for BI verification.

Not eligible:
- Cases where the petitioner does not have a 13A marriage visa (dependent attachment is specific to parent holding the 13A classification).
- Cases where BI requires a different dependent pathway (for example 13B/13C depending on petitioner status) — this service will advise and route the case accordingly.

## Required documents

### Documents the client must provide (cannot be produced by this service)

**Child's Birth Certificate**
- Type: original × 1
- Requirement: Official birth certificate showing parentage (PSA or locally accepted original). The original will be presented to BI and normally returned after release.
- How used: Core evidence of parent–child relationship for dependent inclusion.

**Father's Marriage Certificate**
- Type: original × 1
- Requirement: PSA or equivalent certified marriage certificate proving the father's marriage (basis for 13A classification).
- How used: Proof of the spouse relationship and 13A basis.

**Notes:** The source evidence explicitly lists only these two required originals. Clients are strongly advised to also provide the child's passport and parent's passport (originals or copies) if available — these are commonly requested by BI during submission and can speed processing.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Variable — immediate BI enquiry may be same-day; if a 9A update is required the update and subsequent dependent submission typically take between several days and a few weeks depending on BI workload and document completeness.

### Step 1: Immigration enquiry and eligibility check

**Estimated duration:** 1 business day (may vary)

Specific actions:
1. Contact or visit the Bureau of Immigration to confirm whether the child must have their 9A record updated before inclusion under the father's 13A. This is the primary decision point.
2. Record BI guidance: whether a formal 9A update/extension is mandatory, optional, or unnecessary for direct inclusion.

**Needed documents (for the enquiry):**
- Child's birth certificate (scan or original if convenient)
- Father's marriage certificate (scan helpful for the enquiry)

**Notes:**
- Evidence from chat records indicates an operational confirmation that the baby's 9A may need updating before inclusion. Always confirm with BI in the specific office where submission will occur.

### Step 2A: If BI allows direct inclusion without 9A update

**Estimated duration:** 1–3 weeks (dependent on BI processing for dependent attachment)

Specific actions:
1. Prepare the dependent inclusion packet (13A dependent attachment) using the child's birth certificate and father's marriage certificate plus any BI forms.
2. Submit the packet to BI or to the authorized representative channel (if BI accepts representation).
3. Monitor processing and respond to BI requests for additional evidence.

**Completion sign:** BI issues a submission receipt and later returns an endorsement confirming the child's inclusion under the parent's 13A.

### Step 2B: If BI requires a 9A update before inclusion

**Estimated duration:** variable (days to weeks depending on BI schedule)

Specific actions:
1. Prepare and submit a 9A update or extension request for the child (collect original passport if required by BI, submit the 9A packet along with the birth certificate and relevant forms).
2. Complete any BI instructions (payments, biometrics if applicable, attendance) for the child's 9A update.
3. Once the 9A update/endorsement is confirmed and returned, prepare the dependent inclusion packet and submit to BI as in Step 2A.

**Completion sign:** BI issues the updated 9A confirmation and later the dependent inclusion endorsement.

### Key attention points
- The child in the source case was never processed by BI since birth — inform BI of that status. This can affect what BI requires for initial registration or update.
- There is evidence of a penalty risk if the child's visa is not updated before exiting the country. Do not plan international travel until BI confirms the child's record is regularized or the dependent inclusion is processed.
- Always keep originals safe and obtain BI receipts for every submission. Originals are commonly borrowed by BI and returned only upon release.

## Price & Fees

No firm agent or official BI price is recorded in the source evidence for this specific advisory/handling task. Official Bureau of Immigration fees apply and are payable at the time of BI submission; agent handling fees (if charged) should be quoted at intake depending on whether a 9A update is required and on case complexity.

**Price notes:**
- If a 9A update is required, expect standard BI extension or endorsement charges plus any agent handling fee.
- If the case proceeds directly to 13A dependent attachment, agent handling fees and BI endorsement fees are separate and will be confirmed during intake.

## Important notes / Risks

### Processing limitations
- Many BI actions require the principal or child's physical presence for identity verification, photos, or biometrics. Confirm whether BI accepts an authorised representative for any required step.

### Timing requirements
- Do not attempt international travel before BI confirms the child's 9A update or dependent inclusion; doing so may trigger penalties or denied re-entry.

### Risk warnings
- Failure to update the child's 9A when BI requires it before exit may incur fines or administrative penalties. Always obtain BI confirmation in writing (receipt / endorsement) before travel.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does every child have to update 9A before being attached to a parent's 13A?**
A: Not always. BI guidance is case-specific. The correct first step is to enquire at BI: some children can be included directly, others require a 9A update first. This service performs that enquiry and takes the required next steps.

**Q: What documents must I bring for the enquiry?**
A: At minimum, bring the child's birth certificate and the parent's marriage certificate. A child's passport and parent's passport copy will expedite the process if available.

**Q: How long does the whole process take?**
A: If no 9A update is required, dependent attachment processing typically takes several weeks depending on BI workload. If a 9A update is required first, allow additional time for the update and BI release before dependent submission — total time may extend by weeks.
