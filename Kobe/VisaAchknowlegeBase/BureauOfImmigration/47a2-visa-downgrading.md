# 47a2 Visa Downgrading

## Summary

47a2 Visa Downgrading is a Bureau of Immigration procedure to change a principal's immigration classification when the principal's employment relationship terminates (resignation, termination), the sponsoring company dissolves, or when the employer requests downgrading of a work-related visa under the special 47a2 context. The service handles document collection and submission to relevant government offices (Department of Justice - DOJ; Bureau of Immigration - BI, including BI PEZA where applicable), payment of applicable fees, monitoring, and collection of the resulting Order to Leave (OTL) or other immigration endorsement. Typical clients are foreign employees whose work visa status needs formal closure or conversion because employment has ended.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions before we can process a 47a2 downgrading:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal or an authorized local representative must be in the Philippines for steps that require in-person submission and signature (DOJ/BI procedures frequently require local attendance or accepted representation).
- Relationship prerequisite: The principal must be the visa holder whose visa is being downgraded. In many cases the previous employer or its HR representative supplies supporting documents (for example DOJ indorsement).
- Business prerequisite: The principal must have a passport and accessible immigration records (visa stamp, arrival record, ACR I-Card if available). If the visa stems from an employer action (sponsorship), the employer must cooperate to supply documents such as Certificate of Employment and DOJ indorsement when required.

Not eligible / cannot be handled here:
- Cases where the principal is outside the Philippines and no authorized local representative is permitted for required DO J/BI steps.
- Cases requiring complex litigation or contested deportation appeals (those require immigration counsel beyond administrative downgrading process).

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Variable depending on DOJ and BI workload; typically from several days to a few weeks when documents and endorsements are ready.

### Step 1: Prepare package and obtain DOJ placement (Manila)

Estimated time: 1–5 business days (depending on DOJ queue and employer cooperation)

Specific actions:
1. Collect client-supported documents (passport, passport copies, Certificate of Employment, DOJ 1st Indorsement if available).
2. Draft and finalize the Notice to DOJ and any required letter to the BI Commissioner; obtain client and employer signatures where required.
3. Submit the required documents to DOJ in Manila; obtain a stamped copy as proof of submission or indorsement.

Needed documents:
- Passport (copy/original for verification)
- Certificate of Employment (copy)
- DOJ indorsement (if already issued)
- Notice to DOJ (originals × 2)

Notes:
- DOJ submission often requires employer cooperation; if DOJ has pre-existing files, present reference numbers.

### Step 2: Submit to Bureau of Immigration (BI PEZA office in Taguig when applicable)

Estimated time: 1–7 business days (workload dependent)

Specific actions:
1. Submit the DOJ-stamped documents and BI letter package to BI PEZA (Taguig) or the appropriate BI office.
2. Pay applicable BI fees according to the visa expiry/overstay status (see fees table below).
3. Obtain a claim stub or receipt from BI and note the follow-up schedule.

Needed documents:
- DOJ-stamped copy
- Letter to BI Commissioner (original)
- Notice to PEZA (if applicable)
- Passport originals (presented for verification)

Notes:
- Some documents are collected by BI/PEZA and may not be returned until processing completes.
- Keep all receipts and claim stubs for follow-up.

### Step 3: Payment processing, monitoring and collection of OTL

Estimated time: Days to several weeks depending on BI processing speed

Specific actions:
1. Pay any outstanding fines or fees demanded by BI based on visa expiration or overstay status.
2. Regularly follow up using the BI claim stub reference until the Order to Leave (OTL) is released.
3. Collect the original OTL and other release documents from BI when available; deliver to client.

Possible issues and mitigations:
- Problem: Additional fines or memorandum-driven fees imposed in special cases (example events involving certain nationalities). 
  - Mitigation: Notify client promptly, obtain approvals for payment, and proceed with formal settlement.
- Problem: BI requests further proof or clarifications.
  - Mitigation: Provide quick response and re-submit requested documents; escalate to BI contacts if delay occurs.

## Important notes / Risks

### Processing limitations
- BI/DOJ have discretionary authority: BI may issue an Order to Leave (OTL) or require immediate departure in some cases; this is the principal operational risk.
- Some documents are collected by BI/DOJ and may not be returned until formal release; clients must be prepared for temporary surrender of originals.

### Timing and follow-up
- Processing times depend on DOJ/BI workloads and on employer cooperation for DOJ indorsements. Frequent follow-up using the BI claim stub is necessary.

### Risk warnings
- Incorrectly handling downgrading may trigger enforcement action or additional penalties. Full disclosure of prior overstays and circumstances reduces the risk of unexpected outcomes.

  reason: "A related downgrade procedure; Category 2 covers converting a work visa to tourist status while 47a2 downgrading is the formal DOJ/BI administrative downgrading that may apply when employment ends. Both procedures share risk of OTL and overlap in operational steps."

- name: "ECC Filing"
