# 9G Visa Assistance

## Summary

9G Visa Assistance provides advisory, document-verification and case-coordination support for employer-sponsored 9G work visa matters. This service is intended for employers, human resources teams, and sponsored employees who need an independent verification of company documents, assurance against counterfeit paperwork, or operational coordination with the Bureau of Immigration (BI) to resolve documentation issues that block 9G filings. Typical use-cases include pre-filing company-document authenticity checks, remedial coordination when BI raises questions about sponsor documents, and liaison activities to expedite or clarify BI requirements. The service does not itself substitute for formal 9G filing (the 9G Application service handles submission and biometric coordination), but it reduces risk and the chance of rejection caused by invalid or incomplete company evidence.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to request 9G Visa Assistance:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal or an authorized local representative should be available in the Philippines for any steps that require in-person verification or delivery of originals. Some advisory work (document review) can be performed remotely with high-quality scans.
- Relationship prerequisite: There must be an employer sponsorship relationship or clear employer support for the 9G filing; the service assumes the client is the employer, HR representative, or the sponsored employee with employer authority to share company records.
- Business prerequisite: The client must have primary identity documents (passport) and the company documents that are intended to support the 9G filing (for example company registration, AEP, employment contracts). If essential sponsor documents are missing, the service will advise and can coordinate auxiliary tasks or referrals to obtain them.

Not eligible:
- Cases that rely wholly on forged or counterfeit company documents. Fake company documents are not acceptable and this service will refuse to support filings relying on fraudulent documents.
- Cases where the client cannot provide any employer authorization or has no relationship with a sponsoring employer.

## Required documents

### Must be provided by the client (cannot be produced by this service)

**Company Documents (core):**
- Type: original × 1 (or certified originals as required)
- Requirement: Formal corporate documents proving the employer's legal existence and authority to sponsor (examples: Certificate of Incorporation, SEC/DTI registration, Business Mayor's Permit, BIR registration, corporate secretary minutes or board resolution authorizing the 9G sponsorship). Documents must be legitimate and verifiable with issuing agencies.
- How used: Documents will be reviewed, verified with issuing authorities as needed, and submitted to BI or referenced in a verification report. Note: in specific BI interactions some originals may be collected by immigration and not returned until release — this depends on BI practice and will be communicated.
- Consumable attribute: MAY be collected by BI in the later submission stage. During our verification step we do not remove originals unless explicitly authorized by the client.

**Employment Evidence (recommended):**
- Employment contract, company letter of support, proof of salary or employer TIN. These are client-supplied materials used to cross-check company legitimacy and sponsorship basis.

### Documents this service can produce

## Outcome / Deliverables

Upon completion of this service the client will receive:

- Company Verification Report (digital PDF) — describes verification findings, list of validated documents, and any red flags.
- Action plan for remediation (if required) — steps to obtain missing or corrected documents, list of auxiliary services to engage, and recommended timelines.
- If requested, a short liaison note or formal query to BI summarizing the verified evidence and requesting guidance or acceptance (copy supplied to client).

Note: This service does not itself produce a BI visa endorsement or I-Card; it produces verification outputs and coordination support that materially reduce the chance of a 9G filing being rejected for document issues.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Typically 2–7 business days for verification and reporting, depending on the number of company documents and whether third-party confirmations (for example SEC or DOLE) are required.

### Step 1: Intake and document submission

**Estimated duration:** 0.5–1 business day

**Actions:**
1. Collect high-resolution scans or originals (as agreed) of the employer/company documents and employment evidence from the client.
2. Confirm the client’s authority to disclose these company documents and obtain written authorization where necessary.

**Needed items:** Company Documents, Employment Evidence, client contact and authorization.

**Notes:** If documents are only partial or missing, document the gaps and proceed to Step 1a (remediation planning).

---

### Step 1a: Remediation planning (conditional)

**Estimated duration:** 0.5–3 business days

**Actions:**
1. Identify which documents are missing, inconsistent, or potentially fraudulent.
2. Produce a remediation plan that lists required actions (for example obtain corporate secretary certification, secure original AEP, acquire notarized employer letter) and recommended auxiliary services or government contacts.

**Completion sign:** Client approves remediation plan and authorizes next steps.

---

### Step 2: Document verification

**Estimated duration:** 1–5 business days (depending on agency response times)

**Actions:**
1. Verify documents against issuing agencies or public registries where possible (SEC/DTI, BIR, DOLE, court registries). Record verification results in the Company Verification Report.
2. Check employment evidence for consistency with company registration data and sponsor authority.
3. If any anomalies or suspected forgeries are detected, escalate to the client immediately with recommended containment steps.

**Completion sign:** Company Verification Report compiled and delivered to client.

---

### Step 3: Coordination with Bureau of Immigration (optional)

**Estimated duration:** Variable (same day to several days)

**Actions:**
1. Where BI requires clarification or additional evidence, coordinate a concise submission or explanatory note to BI using the verified materials and remediation letters.
2. If BI intends to collect originals, advise client on custody expectations and arrange secure handover or representative pickup as authorized.
3. Monitor BI response and advise the client on next steps (for example proceed to 9G Application, request a 9G Order Copy, or pursue restamping).

**Completion sign:** BI acknowledges the verification package or provides guidance allowing the 9G filing to proceed.

## Price & Fees

No fixed public retail price is recorded in the extracted source evidence. Fees for this advisory/verification service vary by scope (number of documents, number of third-party confirmations, and whether BI liaison is requested). Client will receive a written quote at intake that may include hourly rates for research and fixed fees for the verification report and BI coordination.

**Price notes:**
- Official government fees for document certification or agency searches are charged separately and are payable in addition to the service fee.
- If the client requests representation or original delivery to BI, courier and handling fees will be added.

---

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Key restrictions
- Fake or forged company documents are not acceptable for 9G processing. This service will not proceed with filings that rely on demonstrably fraudulent evidence.
- The client must provide clear authorization to share employer documents with government agencies or third parties as needed for verification.

### Document custody
- Some government agencies (including BI) may temporarily hold originals during processing. The service will inform the client in advance if originals are likely to be surrendered and will obtain explicit approval.

### Risk warnings
- If a company is not legitimately registered or the employer cannot corroborate sponsorship evidence, BI may refuse the 9G application and enforcement action could follow. The verification service reduces this risk by identifying issues early.

**Q: What happens if my company documents fail verification?**
A: We prepare a remediation plan and advise on lawful corrective steps. If evidence suggests fraud, we will stop and advise the employer and employee on legal compliance options.
