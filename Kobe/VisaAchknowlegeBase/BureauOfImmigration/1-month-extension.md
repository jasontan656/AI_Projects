# 1 Month Extension

## Summary

A 1 Month Extension is a short-term stay extension processed with the Bureau of Immigration for foreign nationals who require an additional month of legal stay beyond their current visa validity. Typical users are visa holders who need immediate temporary extension while waiting for subsequent clearance or processing (for example, ECC filing). The service handles reporting the extension completion and safeguarding required documents until immigration releases them. This task is a stand-alone solo task but is often a prerequisite for ECC filing when both are required sequentially.

1mo extension is occupying the document, because it is consumed to file. You have to report first 1 month extension to finish. Next is you start to report for ECC.
