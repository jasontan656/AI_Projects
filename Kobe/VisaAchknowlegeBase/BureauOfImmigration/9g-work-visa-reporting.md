# 9G Work Visa Reporting

## Summary

9G Work Visa Reporting is a short procedural service that explains how a 9G visa holder must check in / report to the Bureau of Immigration (BI) after receiving a 9G endorsement or when BI specifically requests in-person reporting. Typical users are foreign employees who already hold a 9G endorsement (I-Card or visa sticker) and who are asked to appear at BI to complete a photo capture, identity verification and short reporting procedure. The service is not a full application package; it documents the minimal documents required, the physical steps at the BI counter, and optional agent assistance if the visa holder cannot communicate with immigration staff.

This task is appropriate when someone asks: "How do I do the 9G reporting (报到)?" The work clarifies what the principal must bring, what happens at the BI counter, any optional assistance cost from an intermediary (agent) and key risks or timing notes to plan travel or appointment availability.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to complete 9G Work Visa Reporting:

- Geographic prerequisite: The visa holder must be physically present in the Philippines for in-person reporting and photo/biometrics (BI normally requires local attendance for this step).
- Relationship prerequisite: None beyond being the 9G visa holder or a properly authorised representative when BI accepts representation for the specific action.
- Business prerequisite: The holder must possess the valid passport and the 9G visa card / I-Card (or the passport visa endorsement) as primary proof of status.

Not eligible:
- Persons who are outside the Philippines and cannot arrange an authorised representative where BI disallows representation for the reporting step.
- Cases where the client's BI record is flagged (OTL / blacklist / DERO) — those require dedicated remediation before routine reporting.

## Required documents

### Documents the client must provide (cannot be produced by this service)

**Passport**
- Type: original × 1
- Requirement: Valid national passport presented for identity verification at BI. The passport may be temporarily held by immigration during processing and will be returned upon completion.
- Use: Identification and cross-check of visa endorsement.

**9G Visa Card / I-Card or passport visa endorsement**
- Type: original × 1
- Requirement: Official BI 9G I-Card (or the passport page with 9G endorsement) used to prove the holder's 9G classification. Must be the original document presented to BI.
- Use: Identity verification and to record the reporting activity. The card is typically borrowed and returned.

### Documents the service can produce (if requested)

- Reporting checklist and appointment guidance (producer: 9G Work Visa Reporting) — a short one-page guidance note used by the principal or their authorised representative when attending BI.

---

## Documents obtained after completion

After the reporting/attendance at BI the holder may receive:

**BI Reporting Acknowledgement (if issued)**
- Type: official/administrative acknowledgement or short receipt. Use: Evidence that the holder attended and completed the required BI reporting step. Not all BI counters issue a separate paper acknowledgment; if BI provides a receipt, keep it with case records.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Usually same-day (minutes to a few hours) depending on BI queue and whether an appointment is required.

### Step 1: Prepare and attend BI counter

**Estimated duration:** same day (allow 1–4 hours including travel and queue time)

**Actions:**
1. Bring original passport and original 9G I-Card / visa endorsement.
2. Go to the Bureau of Immigration office specified in your notice or the local BI office that handles 9G reporting.
3. Present identity documents at the counter and state you are there to perform the 9G reporting / acknowledgement.

**Required documents:**
- Passport (original)
- 9G I-Card or passport visa endorsement (original)

**Note:** If the BI counter requires a specific appointment or printed notice, follow the instructions in that appointment message. Some BI tasks are walk-in but expect variable queue times.

### Step 2: Photo / biometrics and short administrative steps

**Estimated duration:** 5–30 minutes (depends on BI procedures and queue)

**Actions:**
1. BI staff will verify the passport and 9G card, may take an in-person photograph, and record the reporting in their system.
2. Follow any instructions given by BI staff (for example signing a form, confirming contact details).
3. Receive any BI acknowledgement or receipt and retrieve your originals when BI completes the check.

**Completion sign:** BI confirms your reporting is recorded and returns passport/I-Card if held.

**Possible issues & mitigations:**
- If language barrier prevents the holder from completing the counter tasks, an authorised local agent or interpreter can assist. See Price & Fees below for a typical agent handling fee recorded in chat evidence.

## Price & Fees

| Effective Date | Currency | Amount | Applicable Conditions | Notes | Evidence |
|---------------:|:--------:|------:|---------------------|------|---------:|
| 2025-04 | PHP | 2,500 | Agent assistance fee (optional) | If the holder cannot communicate with BI (no English), an agent can accompany and complete reporting on the holder's behalf for a service fee. If the holder can communicate in English the agent is not required. | message 637296 |

**Price notes:**
- The PHP 2,500 figure is an agent/service fee recorded in chat evidence as an on-demand service when the principal cannot self-communicate at BI. Official BI counters may charge standard BI fees for some services; those government fees (if any) are payable directly to BI and are separate from agent fees.

---

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Processing limitations
- BI may require the principal's physical attendance for photograph or biometric capture; representation is not always accepted. Confirm at intake whether BI accepts an authorised representative.
- If the BI record shows enforcement flags or missing underlying documentation (for example missing 9G order), reporting may escalate into a different administrative workflow and require additional documents or services.

### Time considerations
- Arrive early at BI counters to reduce queue time. BI offices can be busy and processing times vary by location and daily load.

### Risk warnings
- Do not travel while your passport or I-Card is held without confirming expected release timing. BI sometimes retains originals for short periods during processing.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need an agent to perform 9G reporting?**  
A: No. If you can communicate with BI (English or Philippines local language as needed) you can normally do the reporting yourself. An agent may be helpful when the holder cannot communicate or prefers representation; the chat evidence shows an agent fee of PHP 2,500 in one extracted discussion.

**Q: What happens if BI asks for additional documents during reporting?**  
A: BI will request the missing documents; you must obtain and bring them or arrange for an authorised representative to submit them on your behalf if BI allows representation.

**Q: Will BI keep my passport or I-Card?**  
A: BI may temporarily hold originals during certain processing steps. In normal reporting the originals are returned the same day or when BI completes the short administrative action. Always obtain a receipt if BI retains originals.
