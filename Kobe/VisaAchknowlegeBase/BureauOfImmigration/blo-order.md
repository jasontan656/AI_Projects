# BLO Order

## Summary

A BLO Order service describes the operational steps and client guidance for obtaining a Bureau "blacklist" order copy or a related BI order (commonly referenced as a BLO). This document explains who needs this order copy, what the usual inputs are, how the operational process works (including practical payment options that appear in chat evidence), estimated unofficial costs observed in the field, and the risks and legal/administrative implications of using order-copy or shortcut channels. Use this service when a client needs a certified copy of a Bureau order that affects their immigration record (for example a blacklist/OTL/DERO order) so they can proceed with remediation, appeals, or travel planning.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions before requesting a BLO Order copy or implementation advice:

- Geographic prerequisite: The applicant or an authorised local representative should be in the Philippines because BI record retrieval and any in-person interactions normally require local attendance.
- Relationship prerequisite: The requester should be the subject of the order (the person named in the record) or a properly authorised representative (company HR, lawyer, or agent) who can demonstrate legal authority to request copies.
- Business prerequisite: The client must have identity documents (passport) and at least one identifying reference (name, passport number, approximate order date) so BI records can be located. If the order reference is unknown, allow time for a records search or order-copy retrieval service to locate the file.

Not eligible:
- Requests where no identifying information is available to locate the record.
- Requests that require formal adjudication or legal appeals rather than a simple copy retrieval; legal counsel is required in contested cases.

## Required documents

### Documents the client must provide (cannot be produced by this service)

- Passport (original or clear scanned copy)
  - Type: original or scanned copy
  - Requirement: Passport bio page with full name and passport number. Used to search BI records and to verify identity for any official request.

- Basic identity metadata
  - Type: text (name as on passport, passport number, approximate filing or event date, employer or sponsor name if relevant)
  - Requirement: Helps BI staff to locate the correct order file when the exact reference is not known.

- Authorisation letter (if using a representative)
  - Type: original signed authorisation or notarised SPA when BI requires it
  - Requirement: Allows an agent to request and collect record copies on the client's behalf when permitted by BI.

### Documents the service can help produce

- Search request packet (prepared by this service)
  - A short cover letter and the structured search form used to ask BI for a copy of the order file.

- Formal order-copy retrieval request (if BI requires a formal application)
  - If the record cannot be located immediately, the agent will prepare the formal request and relay required details to BI.

## What the client receives

- A certified copy or copy-of-record of the BLO (BI order) when the issuing office provides it. The copy may be a scanned certified PDF or a physical certified copy depending on BI practice.
- A short case note describing the search steps, the BI reference number located (if any), and a recommended next step (for example submit BLO Lifting, start legal appeal, or plan travel).

## Process / Steps (operational)

**Total estimated duration:** Varies by BI workload; record retrieval usually takes from same-day to several business days when the file is locatable. 

### Step 1 — Intake and identity verification
1. Collect the passport copy and the minimal identifiers needed to find the BI file (name, passport number, approximate date or context).
2. Confirm whether the client wants a certified hard-copy, a scanned certified copy, or only a case summary.
3. Obtain signed authorisation if an agent will act on the client's behalf.

**Deliverables:** Intake form, client consent/authorisation.

### Step 2 — Records search / locate order
1. Submit a targeted search request to BI records using the provided identifiers. The agent will check internal BI channels and any accessible contact groups for a quick locate.
2. If the file is located, request the production of a certified copy or an electronic certified PDF if available.
3. If the file cannot be immediately located, prepare a formal order-copy retrieval submission to BI and record a case reference.

**Deliverables:** BI search status note; either a found-file confirmation or a retrieval request number.

### Step 3 — Pay official fees and collect copy (as required)
1. If BI requires official reproduction fees or if the client requests agent-paid handling, collect payment instructions or pay the fee and obtain receipts.
2. Collect the certified copy when issued and validate the document content (order number, dates, signatures).

**Deliverables:** Certified order copy (digital or physical); official payment receipts where applicable.

### Step 4 — Advisory & next steps
1. Deliver the certified copy to the client and provide an advisory note describing how to use it (for appeals, ALO lifting, or travel planning).
2. If the client requests, propose the related remediation services (ALO Lifting, 9G Order Copy Request, airport exit options) and provide estimated timelines and fees.

**Deliverables:** Advisory note, related-service referrals.

## Price & Fees (operational evidence)

The following figures are extracted from frontline chat evidence and represent operational practices recorded in the dataset. These are not official BI fees — they are field-observed amounts recorded in conversations and should be treated as indicative only. Always confirm official fee schedules with BI.

| Effective Date | Currency | Amount | Applicable Conditions | Notes |
| -------------- | -------- | ------:| -------------------- | ----- |
| 2024-06 | PHP | 1010 | Typical amount recorded for producing a receipt/order copy when combined with an OPS handling flow | Chat evidence recorded a practice: 1010 PHP for the receipt/order (official-looking copy) in combination with an OPS channel. |
| 2024-06 | PHP | 1500 | Tip or additional handling charge commonly recorded in discussions | Separate amount typically recorded as a "tip" or informal handling between officers; field evidence shows a 1500 PHP option. |

Operational scenarios observed in chat evidence:
- Option A: With OPS channel + official receipt/copy = ~PHP 1010 plus an additional tip for handling (recorded examples included 1500 PHP as a tip). 
- Option B: Without OPS/receipt = ~PHP 1500 (a single amount recorded in some discussions, described as a simpler option to obtain a copy without an OPS slip).

**Price explanation & risk note:** These figures reflect extracted chat evidence about real-world operational payments and potential informal tips. Using such unofficial channels may expose clients to legal or reputational risk. Always seek official BI receipts and document trails for any payment. The agent will insist on official receipts wherever possible and will not advise or facilitate unlawful payments.

## Attention & Risks

- Some chat evidence describes operational tips or informal payments to expedite order copies. Those practices are informal and may violate agency rules; clients should insist on official receipts and formal channels where possible.
- A certified BI order copy can be a sensitive and legal document. Do not publish or distribute copies except to authorised counsel or government agencies.
- If the order relates to enforcement (OTL, blacklist), obtaining the copy is a step; removal or legal remedy (BLO/ALO lifting) requires a separate administrative or legal process and cannot be achieved simply by obtaining a copy.

## Notes for handlers

- Prioritise obtaining official BI receipts and certified copies; treat any field-reported tip amounts as historical observations, not recommended standard practice.
- If the client instructs to use an authorised official retrieval process (9G Order Copy Request) prefer that route and collect the formal BI-certified copy.
- When handling sensitive enforcement files, coordinate with legal counsel for remedial steps rather than trying to circumvent formal processes.
