# 13A Visa Progress Inquiry

## Summary

A short standalone service to check the processing status of an existing 13A visa-related application or I-Card request with the Bureau of Immigration (BI) or via the client's communication group. Typical users are clients who have already submitted a 13A marriage visa, renewal, I-Card replacement, or dependent attachment and need an update to plan travel or document collection.

---

## Background prerequisites

Clients must meet the following conditions to use this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The client or an authorized representative should be available in the Philippines when in-person follow-up is required by BI. Remote status checks are possible when BI provides an online or phone status channel.
- Relationship prerequisite: None beyond being the applicant or authorized representative for the 13A matter in question.
- Business prerequisite: The client must have submitted an application previously (for example 13A marriage visa application, I-Card replacement, renewal, or dependent attachment) and must have submission receipts, reference numbers, or the group chat thread that contains the submission details.

Not eligible:
- Cases where no prior submission exists (this task is only a status inquiry).
- Situations where BI requires a formal written petition or in-person remedy rather than a status update.

---

## Documents / information the client must provide

These items are required to perform a status inquiry. They cannot be produced by this service.

- Submission receipt or BI reference number:
  - Type: copy × 1
  - Requirement: Any submission receipt, payment receipt, BI reference number, or acknowledgment that identifies the client's case.
  - How used: Used to query BI or to post in the group for a progress update.

- Client contact details and passport number:
  - Type: information
  - Requirement: Full name, passport number, and contact information to verify identity with BI if needed.

- Group chat link or message context (if previous discussion occurred in a messaging group):
  - Type: copy / link
  - Requirement: If the client previously discussed the case in a group, provide the relevant message or link so the agent can ask colleagues/admins for updates.

---

## Outcome / deliverables

Upon completion of this task the client will receive:

- Progress update summary (documented by the agent): current BI status, expected next steps, any missing documents requested by BI, and estimated timeline if available.
- Recommended action plan: if BI requires additional documents or in-person attendance, the agent will list the exact requirements and propose next steps (for example schedule appointment, collect missing PSA/NBI, or arrange authorized representative attendance).

---

## Process / Steps

Total estimated duration: Same day to several business days depending on BI responsiveness.

### Step 1: Intake and verification

Estimated time: within 24 hours

Specific actions:
1. Client provides submission receipt / BI reference number, passport number, and any relevant group chat messages.
2. Agent verifies the identity and locates the case reference within internal records or the provided chat thread.

Needed items:
- Submission receipt / BI reference
- Client identity (name, passport number)

Notes:
- If the client lacks a formal receipt, the agent will attempt a progress check using available identifiers (passport number, name) but success depends on BI rules.

### Step 2: Request status update

Estimated time: same day to 2 business days depending on channel

Specific actions:
1. Query BI via official channels (online case portal, phone, or in-person) using the provided reference.
2. If the case was discussed in a client/admin group, post a concise inquiry in the group asking for any internal update and capture any replies.
3. Record BI response or internal group replies and summarise findings for the client.

Completion sign:
- Receipt of BI status response, or a message from group admins confirming the current processing stage.

### Step 3: Advise next steps and follow-up

Estimated time: variable

Specific actions:
1. If BI requests additional documents or action, notify the client with a clear checklist and deadlines.
2. If no action is needed, provide an estimated timeline and propose periodic check-ins until completion.
3. If escalation is required (for example prolonged delay), propose escalation options and assistance costs if any.

Possible issues and mitigation:
- BI unresponsive: escalate via in-person visit or formal written follow-up.
- Missing reference: advise the client to retrieve submission receipt or authorize an agent to query in person.

## Price & Fees

This is a lightweight inquiry service. Typical agent handling fees (if charged) are modest; confirm fee at intake. No fixed official BI fee applies for an inquiry itself. If the inquiry requires in-person escalation or extended case management, additional service fees may apply and will be quoted.

---

## Important notes / limitations

- This task does not guarantee a faster decision from BI; the agent can only request or report status updates.
- If BI requires in-person appearances or production of originals, the client must attend or provide an authorized representative and appropriate documents.
- Keep submission receipts and reference numbers safe; inquiries without a valid reference are often unsuccessful.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Can you get BI to prioritise my case?
A: We can request status and advise escalation when justified, but we cannot guarantee priority processing by BI.

Q: What information do you need to check progress?
A: Submission receipt or BI reference number, applicant full name, and passport number. If the case was discussed in a group, include the relevant message or thread link.
