# ALO Airport Exit Clearance

## Summary

ALO Airport Exit Clearance is a focused, operational service that arranges an expedited airport exit procedure for individuals who have an Alien Landing Order (ALO) recorded in immigration systems and require an immediate, managed exit with minimal on‑file entry/exit traces. The service is intended for cases where the ALO condition has been confirmed and the client needs to depart the Philippines quickly and discreetly through an arranged channel at the airport. Typical users are individuals who have an ALO or equivalent administrative flag and who need a fast departure solution that minimizes further immigration complications. This service is time‑sensitive: operational channels are unstable and clients are advised to act quickly. The target turnaround for arranged departures is commonly within 1 week when the channel and logistics are available.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to use ALO Airport Exit Clearance:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal must be physically present in the Philippines and able to attend the designated airport exit appointment (some preparatory work can be done remotely, but final airport attendance is required).
- Relationship prerequisite: The principal must be the person subject to the ALO or an authorised representative with written authorization accepted by the operator and airport services.
- Business prerequisite: The client must have verifiable identity documents (passport) and either already know they have an ALO recorded or be willing to allow the agent to confirm the ALO status through available internal channels.

Not eligible / cannot be handled by this service:
- Cases where the client does not have an ALO or any administrative immigration enforcement flag is unclear — these require a separate status check and advisory first.
- Cases with active criminal proceedings, formal deportation orders, or other enforcement actions that cannot be resolved administratively at the airport.
- Clients who are outside the Philippines and cannot attend the required airport appointment.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Typically up to 1 week from intake to arranged airport exit when operational channels are available. The timeline depends on channel availability and airport scheduling.

### Step 1: Intake and ALO eligibility check

**Estimated duration:** 0.5–2 days

**Specific actions:**
1. Client provides passport copy and authorises the agent to confirm the ALO status through internal channels.
2. Agent reviews the case and confirms whether the client qualifies operationally for the ALO exit channel.

**Needed documents:**
- Passport (scan)
- Client signed authorization to proceed and to perform status confirmation

**Notes:**
- If client does not have a confirmed ALO, perform a status check first (separate service). The ALO Airport Exit Clearance service requires either confirmed ALO or strong operational evidence that the case is suitable.

---

### Step 2: Channel arrangement and logistics

**Estimated duration:** 1–5 days (depends on channel stability)

**Specific actions:**
1. Agent secures an available operational exit channel and coordinates the airport date/time. Channels are operationally unstable; availability is not guaranteed.
2. Agent instructs client on ticket purchase timing and deposit payment (deposit is required to secure the booking and channel reservation).
3. Collect deposit (see Payment section) and obtain client confirmation of flight purchase when requested.

**Needed documents:**
- Client deposit payment confirmation
- Tentative or confirmed flight booking as instructed by agent

**Completion sign:** Channel confirmed, date/time set, deposit received.

---

### Step 3: Airport execution

**Estimated duration:** Execution day (a few hours)

**Specific actions:**
1. Client arrives at airport at the appointed time and presents passport and supporting documents.
2. Agent or escort coordinates the special counter flow and arranges the exit process.
3. Upon successful gate processing and airline acceptance, client boards and departs. Remaining balance payment (if any) is collected as per contract.

**Possible issues and mitigations:**
- Issue: Channel is denied at the last minute due to operational changes.
  - Mitigation: Agent will attempt alternative channels or reschedule as soon as possible; client may be refunded per the payment terms.
- Issue: Airline refuses boarding due to carrier rules.
  - Mitigation: Agent coordinates with the airline and provides required documentation; in some cases the client must resolve carrier concerns directly.

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Service limitations
- This service facilitates an operational airport exit channel for confirmed ALO cases only. It does not remove the ALO from immigration records. If the client requires ALO lifting (record removal), use the ALO Lifting service (related business) which is a distinct administrative/legal process.
- The operator cannot guarantee airline acceptance; airlines retain boarding authority and may refuse boarding based on carrier rules.

### Timing requirements
- Channels are time-sensitive. Agent recommends initiating intake as soon as possible after the client decides to depart. Delay increases the risk that channels are unavailable.

### Risk warnings
- The arranged channel is not an official guarantee of immunity from immigration enquiries. The client may still face additional checks by immigration or carrier officials in exceptional circumstances.
- Refunds: Deposit refunds are subject to the service agreement and to costs already incurred to secure the channel. Review the payment contract carefully before paying deposits.
