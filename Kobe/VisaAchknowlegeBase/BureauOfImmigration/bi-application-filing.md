# BI Application Filing

## Summary

BI Application Filing is an operational support service that assists clients to submit documents and applications directly at designated Bureau of Immigration (BI) counters (commonly referenced as windows 20 and 21). The task includes preparing the submission packet, coordinating a friendly endorsement or liaison within BI when available, lodging the packet at the correct BI window, and monitoring the short-term processing until the submission receipt is obtained. This service is strictly an administrative lodging and follow-up service; it does not guarantee adjudication outcomes.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to use this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The applicant or an authorised local representative must be physically present in the Philippines when BI requires original documents to be submitted or identity verification at the counter. Remote advisory is possible but final lodging often requires local presence.

- Relationship prerequisite: None beyond being the owner of the documents or an authorised representative. If a third party submits the application on behalf of the principal, the principal must provide a signed authorization letter acceptable to BI.

- Business prerequisite: The applicant must have the required original documents requested by BI for the specific filing (passport, previous immigration receipts, marriage certificate, company documents, etc.). The service helps assemble and check the packet but cannot create legal source documents (for example PSA certificates) on behalf of the client.

Not eligible:
- Cases where the client cannot provide the necessary original documents and no third-party can legally obtain them in time.
- Complex legal cases that require counsel or appeals rather than a simple BI counter submission.

## Documents required (must be provided by client)

The following documents must be supplied by the client for any BI filing. Specific filings will require additional items; the agent will confirm the final checklist at intake.

- Passport (original): original × 1 — valid passport used for identity verification and submission. Immigration may borrow originals during processing and will return them when BI releases the case.

- Application-specific supporting documents: examples include marriage certificate (PSA), birth certificates, existing BI orders (9G/13A), previous BI receipts, employer AEP or company documents for work/visa filings. Type and quantity depend on the filing purpose.

- Completed application forms or cover letter where a form is required by BI for this specific case.

Notes: Originals are typically presented at the counter. If the client lacks any required original, the agent will identify auxiliary services required (for example PSA request, AEP retrieval) before lodging the BI packet.

---

## Documents the service can produce

- Submission packet (completed forms, cover letter, index): Producer: BI Application Filing — the agent prepares a ready-to-lodge packet that the client or authorised representative can submit at BI windows 20/21.

- Liaison memo and follow-up note: Producer: BI Application Filing — internal case note and suggested next steps; used to track the submission and to escalate to BI contacts if necessary.

---

## Documents obtained after completion

- BI submission receipt / claim stub (official): original or scanned copy × 1 — proof that BI accepted the submission packet and a reference for case monitoring.

- Short submission acknowledgement (agent-produced) — summarises what was submitted, date/time, BI window number, and the responsible agent.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Usually same day to a few business days depending on BI queue and any immediate follow-up requests by BI. Typical timeline: packet preparation (hours) → submission at window 20/21 (same day) → receipt issued (same day) → follow-up monitoring (days).

### Step 1: Intake and packet preparation

**Estimated duration:** 0.5–1 business day

**Actions:**
1. Receive scans of all client documents and confirm which originals will be presented at BI.
2. Verify documents against BI acceptance criteria for the targeted filing.
3. Prepare the submission packet: cover letter, checklist, index of attachments and copies.

**Needed documents:** passport, targeted supporting documents.

**Notes:** The agent will recommend that the client keep originals available. If something is missing, the agent will identify auxiliary tasks required before lodging.

### Step 2: Liaison & submission at BI window 20 or 21

**Estimated duration:** Hours depending on BI queue

**Actions:**
1. Schedule a BI visit if necessary and proceed to the designated counter (commonly windows 20 or 21 as referenced in evidence).
2. Where a friendly endorsement contact exists (agent contact or internal endorsement), the agent will coordinate to present the packet to the right counter and request expedited lodgement where appropriate and permitted.
3. Pay any BI official fees at the cashier when instructed (agent will advise exact amounts per filing).

**Completion sign:** BI official submission receipt / claim stub issued to the submitter.

**Notes:** Windows 20/21 are cited operationally for certain filings; the agent will confirm the correct window and time before arrival.

---

### Step 3: Monitoring and collection of receipt

**Estimated duration:** 1–7 business days depending on BI actions

**Actions:**
1. Monitor the BI reference using the submission receipt and contact the BI counter if additional documentation is requested.
2. Collect the final acknowledgement, and if passport or original documents are retained by BI for processing, confirm release procedures and expected return date.
3. Deliver electronic copies of the BI receipt and case note to the client.

**Completion sign:** Client receives the BI submission receipt and the agent confirmation that the packet is lodged and queued for BI processing.

## Price & Fees

No universal price is recorded in the extracted evidence for general filing at BI windows 20/21. Fees vary by the type of filing (visa, extension, ECC, I-Card processes). This service charges an agent handling fee as negotiated at intake; any official BI fees are payable directly to the Bureau of Immigration or collected by the agent on the client's instruction.

**Evidence-derived operational notes:** the source chat references informal operational help and the existence of a BI contact to endorse the company submission; price must be confirmed at the time of engagement.

---

## Important notes & Restrictions

### Endorsements and contacts
- The extracted evidence mentions an endorsement or inside contact that can facilitate filing at windows 20 and 21. Agents may rely on professional contacts to coordinate lodgement, but such endorsements do not alter BI's legal requirements or guarantee approval.

### Cashiers and payment channels
- The evidence also suggests clients may inquire about direct cashier channels; the agent will advise on cashier locations and accepted payment methods for BI fees.

### Document custody
- BI may temporarily retain originals during certain processes. Clients should plan travel and document needs accordingly.

### Representation
- BI acceptance of authorised representatives varies by filing type. Always present a signed authorization letter when a representative attends on the applicant's behalf.
