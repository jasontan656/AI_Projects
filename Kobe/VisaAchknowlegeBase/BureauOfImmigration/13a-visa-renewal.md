# 13A Visa Renewal

## Summary

13A Visa Renewal is the service to renew or extend an existing 13A spousal visa classification with the Philippine Bureau of Immigration. Typical clients are foreign spouses of Filipino citizens who must renew their probationary one-year 13A, transition to permanent 13A, or otherwise extend valid 13A status before expiry. This service helps prepare required documents, submit the renewal application to BI, coordinate any required in-person attendance (for example biometrics or interview), and follow up until approval or issuance of updated endorsement/I-Card.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to request this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal or an authorized representative should be available in the Philippines when BI requires personal attendance for submission, biometrics, or photo capture. Many renewal steps require physical presence.
- Relationship prerequisite: Applicant must be the foreign spouse of a Filipino citizen (13A is spousal-based) or otherwise already hold a 13A classification that is eligible for renewal.
- Business prerequisite: Applicant must have a valid passport and existing 13A order/endorsement or previous BI paperwork showing current 13A status.

Not eligible:
- Persons who are outside the Philippines and cannot attend required BI procedures where personal attendance is mandatory and no representation is allowed.
- Cases involving a change of visa classification (not a renewal) — those require a separate visa application process.

## Required documents (must be provided by client)

The following documents cannot be produced by this service and must be supplied by the client unless otherwise noted.

- Passport:
  - Type: original × 1
  - Requirement: Valid passport presented for verification and submission when required. Immigration may temporarily hold the passport during processing and return it upon release.
  - Use: Identity and travel document.

- 13A order / previous BI endorsement (copy or original as required):
  - Type: copy/original × 1
  - Requirement: Evidence of prior 13A grant or supporting BI record.
  - Use: Used to demonstrate existing 13A status; usually borrowed for submission and returned when released.

- NBI (No Criminal Record) clearance:
  - Type: original × 1
  - Requirement: As required by BI for renewal/permanent processing; obtain from NBI.
  - Use: Supporting evidence; normally returned after verification.

- Passport photos and any additional documents requested by BI (for example spouse IDs, proof of cohabitation, or affidavits): follow BI specifications.

Notes: If a required document is missing the client must obtain it before submission (for example arrange for NBI clearance or PSA marriage certificate). Some originals may be temporarily retained by BI during processing.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Typically ranges from several weeks to a few months depending on BI workload and case complexity. Evidence reports normal processing that can be 1 month for straightforward renewals but commonly 2–3 months in practice.

### Step 1: Intake and document collection

**Estimated duration:** 1–5 business days depending on document readiness.

Specific actions:
1. Collect passport, 13A order/previous endorsement, NBI clearance (or advise on obtaining NBI), passport photos, and spouse supporting documents.
2. Verify documents meet BI requirements and identify any missing items.
3. Provide the client with a checklist and quote.

**Documents needed:** passport, 13A order, NBI clearance, passport photos.

**Notes:** If the client plans travel around expiry, advise applying for a grace period or ensure renewal submission occurs at least one month before expiry to avoid lapses.

---

### Step 2: Prepare and submit renewal package to Bureau of Immigration

**Estimated duration:** Hours to days to prepare; submission timing depends on BI availability.

Specific actions:
1. Complete BI renewal forms and prepare a cover letter and evidence packet.
2. Submit the packet to the designated BI office and pay applicable BI processing fees.
3. Attend any BI appointments (biometrics/photo or interview) as required.

**Completion sign:** BI provides a submission receipt or acknowledgement.

---

### Step 3: BI processing, follow-up, and issuance

**Estimated duration:** 2–8 weeks or longer depending on BI workload.

Specific actions:
1. Monitor BI case status and respond to BI requests for additional documents.
2. If BI issues approval, coordinate I-Card capture/collection and return any originals to the client upon release.
3. If BI requires further steps (for example filing for permanent 13A), prepare the additional package when appropriate.

**Possible issues and mitigations:**
- If BI requests additional documents (for example police clearances or proof of relationship): obtain and submit promptly.
- If the client's 13A has already expired prior to submission, follow the expired-case procedure (see Special Cases).

---

## Special cases and important notes

- Timing: Submit the renewal application at least one month before the visa expiry date. Evidence indicates applicants typically submit one month before expiry, and BI processing can be slow.

- Grace period and travel: If the client plans to travel and their 13A is near expiry, apply for a BI grace period or ensure the renewal filing covers travel needs. Failure to secure grace or timely renewal can lead to expiry.

- Expired 13A cases: If the 13A has already expired, the usual practical steps reported in evidence are:
  1. Enter the Philippines on a valid tourist visa (if outside) or regularize status as permitted.
  2. Cancel the expired I-Card (ICard cancellation may be required by BI).
  3. Reapply for 13A (this may start a new probationary period depending on BI decision).

- In-person attendance: Many renewal steps require the applicant's personal appearance. Evidence repeatedly emphasizes that applicants must often attend in person. Where representation is permitted by BI, an authorized representative can submit but some steps (photograph / biometrics) may still require presence.

- Permanent conversion: Renewals often include the pathway from probationary (1-year) 13A to permanent 13A. Practical guidance: apply for permanent status around the 10th month of the probationary year (confirm timing with BI at intake).

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Processing limitations
- Applicant presence: The applicant generally must be physically present in the Philippines for key renewal steps (submission, biometrics, photo) unless BI explicitly permits representation.
- Expired status: If the 13A has expired, the client may need to enter on a tourist visa and reapply; procedures can be more complex and may include I-Card cancellation.

### Time-related requirements
- Submit renewal at least one month before expiry to allow for BI processing.
- Processing times vary widely; common reports indicate 1 month in ideal cases and 2–3 months in typical circumstances.

### Risks
- Delays if BI requests additional evidence or if documents (for example NBI clearance, previous 13A order) are missing.
- If the client travels without proper grace/clearance near expiry, they risk visa lapse and more complex remediation steps.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Do I need to be in the Philippines to renew my 13A?**
Yes. Most renewal steps require the principal to be physically present for BI procedures. In limited cases BI accepts an authorized representative for submission, but photo/biometrics or interviews often require presence.

**When should I apply for permanent 13A?**
Practical guidance from evidence suggests applying near the 10th month of the probationary year. Confirm timing during intake because BI guidance can vary.

**What if my 13A has already expired?**
If expired, typical practical steps reported include entering on a tourist visa if outside, cancelling the expired I-Card, and reapplying for 13A. This can trigger a new probationary period depending on BI adjudication.
