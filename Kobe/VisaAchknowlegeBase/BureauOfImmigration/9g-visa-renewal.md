# 9G Visa Renewal

## Summary

9G Visa Renewal is a case-specific, client-facing service to renew an existing 9G employer-sponsored work visa endorsement with the Bureau of Immigration. This document describes a practical operational workflow used to renew a 9G endorsement online and to coordinate physical document pickup and courier delivery (including local courier via Grab). Typical users are foreign employees whose employer or representative handles document submission and delivery on their behalf. The case documented here references a renewal for Zhu Pengze and records the local logistics (document pickup from Ma'am Cha, PDF conversion, online submission, and Grab delivery).

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to request this renewal service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal or an authorized local representative must be physically present in the Philippines or must provide an authorized local representative to submit and receive originals when BI requires them.
- Relationship prerequisite: The applicant is an employer-sponsored foreign employee whose 9G endorsement is active or eligible for renewal.
- Business prerequisite: The client must have a valid passport and the employer/sponsor documentation required by BI for 9G renewal. If an AEP or other employer documents are required for the renewal variant (for example conversion to multi-year), those must be available.

Not eligible:
- Cases where BI policy requires the principal's mandatory biometric attendance and the principal cannot appear or provide permitted representation.
- Cases that require a new 9G application (change of employer, first-time issuance) rather than a renewal/extension — those are handled as separate 9G application services.

---

## Required documents (must be provided by client)

### Must-provide documents

- Passport (original)
  - Type: original × 5 (as noted in the case evidence where multiple passports were collected for batch processing)
  - Requirement: Valid passport; will be presented to the agent and to BI as required. Originals are typically borrowed during BI processing and returned upon release.
  - How used: Identity verification and passport endorsement.

- 2x2 photo
  - Type: original photographic print or compliant digital photo × 1
  - Requirement: BI photo specification compliance (recent, correct background and measurement). Used for the renewal application and I-Card capture if required.

- AEP form (Alien Employment Permit copy)
  - Type: copy × 1
  - Requirement: If the 9G renewal variant requires current AEP evidence (for 3-year renewals or employer-sponsored reissuance), include a copy of the AEP form or DOLE-issued permit.

Notes: The counts above reflect the local operational case: multiple passports were collected from a single pickup location (Ma'am Cha) for courier handoff. For single-customer renewals, 1 original passport is typical; the example used a batch flow.

### Documents the service can produce

- Submission packet (completed BI renewal/endorsement form, cover letter, and checklist)
  - Producer: 9G Visa Renewal

## Documents obtained after completion

- Renewed 9G visa endorsement (passport stamp or BI confirmation)
  - Type: original × 1
  - Use: Updated visa endorsement in passport or BI confirmation indicating renewal. This is the core deliverable of the renewal process.
  - Custody: Passport will be returned to the client when BI releases endorsed documents.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Varies by BI workload and courier schedules; common operational timeline is same-day logistics for document pickup and 1–4 weeks for BI processing depending on BI queue.

### Step 1: Document pickup and handover to courier

**Estimated duration:** Same day (local pickup)

Specific actions:
1. Collect original passports from the agreed pickup location (e.g., collect passports from Ma'am Cha).
2. Place all originals and required supporting items (photos, AEP copy) into a securely sealed brown envelope.
3. Hand the brown envelope to the Grab driver or other approved courier and obtain a courier receipt.

**Notes:** Ensure envelopes are labeled with a return address and case reference. In the documented case a small Grab delivery fee (PHP 92) was recorded for the local courier.

**Evidence / Checklist:**
- Passport originals
- 2x2 photo
- AEP copy
- Brown envelope for courier

### Step 2: Convert documents to PDF and prepare online package

**Estimated duration:** Same day (after pickup)

Specific actions:
1. Scan or photograph each original to produce high-quality, legible PDFs.
2. Convert all files to PDF/A where possible; verify orientation and legibility of each page.
3. Fill out the Bureau of Immigration renewal form electronically (or complete the BI online form) for the principal (e.g., Zhu Pengze) ensuring all fields are correctly populated. If fields are not applicable, follow evidence instructions (for example: fill 'N/A' where evidence recommended).
4. Attach the converted PDFs to the online submission portal or to the BI email upload as required by the current BI channel.

**Notes:** Double-check PDF conversion quality. Corrupt or low-quality PDFs are a frequent cause of rejections and delays.

### Step 3: Submit renewal online and monitor

**Estimated duration:** Same day to several days (monitoring ongoing)

Specific actions:
1. Submit the online renewal package to the Bureau of Immigration portal or the designated submission channel. Retain confirmation numbers and submission receipts.
2. Pay any required BI fees or agent-handling balance per the case payment instructions. Attach payment evidence to the BI packet when necessary.
3. Monitor the BI case through the receipt/claim stub and respond to BI requests for additional documents promptly.

**Completion sign:** BI issues a submission receipt and later returns the passport with the renewed 9G endorsement.

### Step 4: Receive and deliver renewed passport / I-Card

**Estimated duration:** On BI release day (varies)

Specific actions:
1. When BI releases the renewed passport and/or I-Card, arrange secure pickup or courier delivery to the client or designated representative.
2. Obtain a signed release receipt from the recipient, and update case status to 'completed.'

**Notes:** Confirm the renewal term (documented in the evidence as 3-year renewal for this case) and verify that the stamp details match the requested renewal period.

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Handling and custody
- Always place originals in a sealed envelope and record chain-of-custody. When handing originals to couriers or representatives, get a signature and photo evidence of the handover.
- If BI requires the principal's in-person biometric/photo capture, ensure the principal is available for the scheduled appointment.

### File quality and submission
- Verify PDF conversions for clarity and correct page order before submission.
- Use standard filename conventions to help BI staff review (e.g., "Passport_ZhuPengze_Pg1.pdf").

### Renewal term
- In the documented case the renewal was for a three-year period. Confirm the requested validity length with the client and with BI rules before filing.

A: Yes. We use local couriers (Grab or similar) for secure handover and return. The case evidence records a small Grab fee for document pickup and delivery.
