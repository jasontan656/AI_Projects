# 9G Visa with AEP

## Summary

The 9G Visa with AEP is an employer-sponsored work visa service for foreign nationals in the Philippines that combines filing the Bureau of Immigration (BI) 9G application and securing a Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) Alien Employment Permit (AEP). This combined workflow is required when immigration rules mandate an AEP for 9G approvals; typical clients are foreign employees sponsored by a Philippine employer. The service manages document collection, DOLE publication (if applicable), BI biometric scheduling, payment handling, and delivery of the 9G I-Card and AEP card.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet these conditions before we can proceed:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal (applicant) or an authorized local representative must be available in the Philippines for any in-person steps (notably DOLE publication requirements and BI biometric capture).
- Relationship prerequisite: There must be a sponsoring employer willing to provide company supporting documents and to cooperate with AEP filing.
- Business prerequisite: Applicant must hold a valid passport. A formal AEP must be obtained (or in the process) before filing for certain 9G variants (notably multi-year 3-year 9G).

Not eligible:
- Applicants who are outside the Philippines and cannot attend mandatory biometric appointments where BI requires personal appearance.
- Cases where the sponsor cannot or will not provide required employer documents or an AEP.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** BI processing commonly takes ~3 months for 9G; DOLE AEP publication and processing adds additional lead time (AEP publication requires a 15-calendar-day advertisement when applicable). Combined timeline typically ranges from several weeks to ~3 months depending on DOLE and BI workload.

### Step 1: AEP submission and DOLE publication

**Estimated duration:** At least 15 calendar days for publication plus DOLE processing time.

1. Collect employer documents and complete the DOLE AEP application package.
2. Submit AEP application to DOLE and arrange the mandated public advertisement (newspaper) where required.
3. Wait for the 15-calendar-day publication period to complete before DOLE can finalize the AEP.
4. After DOLE finalizes the AEP, collect the AEP card or coordinate pickup with our office.

**Notes:** DOLE practice includes batching of filings; internal evidence mentions a "2nd batch" filing scheduled in the 1st week of August in one cycle. Confirm DOLE schedule at intake.

**Required documents:** employer documents, passport copy, application forms.

### Step 2: Prepare and submit BI 9G application

**Estimated duration:** BI processing commonly ~3 months (subject to BI queue).

1. Prepare the BI 9G application packet once AEP is available (or include proof of AEP application as instructed by BI when appropriate).
2. Schedule and attend BI biometric/fingerprint appointment (applicant attendance typically required).
3. Pay BI deposit/final balance when required and submit proof of payment.
4. Monitor BI until issuance of the 9G I-Card and passport endorsement.

**Required documents:** passport (original for biometric), AEP card or DOLE confirmation, employer supporting documents.

### Step 3: Delivery and closure

1. Collect the 9G I-Card from BI or arrange authorized representative pickup when permitted.
2. Deliver the I-Card and AEP card to the client; issue a release receipt.
3. Close the case and provide guidance on maintaining compliance (annual reviews, renewals).

## Important notes

### Processing limitations
- AEP is mandatory for some 9G filings due to immigration policy changes; BI may reject filings that lack a valid AEP.
- Applicant presence: BI usually requires in-person biometric capture; DOLE may require publication and employer verification steps.

### Time requirements
- DOLE publication requires 15 calendar days after advertisement before AEP finalization in many cases.
- BI processing times vary; a typical observed timeline is ~3 months for 9G issuance.

### Risk warnings
- If DOLE or BI requests additional evidence or finds sponsor documents invalid, the application will be delayed or rejected. Company-document verification before filing reduces this risk.
