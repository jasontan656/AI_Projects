# 9G Work Visa Downgrade to Tourist Visa

## Summary

This service converts a holder's active 9G employer-sponsored work visa record into a tourist-entry status so the principal may remain legally in the Philippines without immediate departure. It is intended for foreign nationals currently holding a 9G who want to close or change their employment-based record and continue stay on tourist terms. The service handles document submission to the Bureau of Immigration (BI), coordination with any required employer or DOJ steps where relevant, monitoring of BI processing, and return of passport and any endorsement or receipts.

---

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions before we can file a 9G → tourist downgrade on their behalf:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal or an authorized local representative should be in the Philippines for any steps that require originals or in-person verification. Some advisory work is possible remotely but BI often requires local presence for submission or clarifications.
- Relationship prerequisite: The applicant must be the 9G visa holder (or an authorized representative acting with explicit written authorization). Employer cooperation may be necessary if company documents are required by BI.
- Business prerequisite: The client must be able to present the passport original, the physical 9G I‑Card, and the original 9G order (or authorize retrieval of an official certified copy). Without the 9G order the downgrade cannot proceed unless a certified copy is retrieved first.

Not eligible:
- Persons outside the Philippines who cannot provide an authorized local representative where BI explicitly requires the principal's personal attendance.
- Cases with unresolved enforcement flags (OTL, blacklist, DERO) that require legal/administrative remediation beyond a routine downgrade.

## Required documents

### Documents the client must provide (cannot be produced by our service)

Passport:
- Type: original × 1
- Requirement: Valid passport presented for identity verification. The passport may be temporarily held by BI during processing and will be returned upon release.
- How used: Identity verification and passport endorsement handling.

9G I‑Card:
- Type: original × 1
- Requirement: The physical 9G I‑Card (front and back); BI typically wants to see the card during downgrade processing.
- How used: Evidence of current classification; borrowed and returned per BI practice.

9G Order:
- Type: original × 1
- Requirement: The official BI order/approval that documents the 9G grant. If the original cannot be provided the client must authorize a certified copy retrieval (see documents_can_produce).
- How used: Primary documentary evidence to support the procedural change.

### Documents our service can produce or retrieve

9G Order (certified copy):
- Produced by: 9G Order Copy Request (BureauOfImmigration/9g-order-copy-request.md)
- Use: If the original 9G order is missing, the certified copy is required before the downgrade can be filed.

---

## Outcome — Documents obtained after completion

- Tourist endorsement / 9A stamp in passport (if BI issues a tourist entry endorsement in lieu of the prior 9G). This is the primary client deliverable when BI approves the change of status.
- BI submission receipt and internal case notes — proof that the downgrade request was filed and processed.

---

## Process / Steps

Total estimated duration: typically 1–2 weeks (standard cases). Faster handling can sometimes complete in 3–5 working days when BI queue and all documents are available. If a 9G order must be retrieved first, add approximately one week for retrieval.

### Step 1: Intake and document verification

Estimated time: 1 business day

Actions:
1. Client provides passport, 9G I‑Card and the 9G order (or explicitly authorizes the agent to retrieve the certified copy).
2. Agent verifies the documents and checks BI record status for any enforcement flags. If enforcement flags are found, agent advises remediation steps instead of filing a normal downgrade.

Needed files:
- Passport (original)
- 9G I‑Card (original)
- 9G Order (original or authorized retrieval)

Notes:
- If the 9G order is missing, stop intake and initiate the 9G Order Copy Request before proceeding to Step 2.

### Step 2: Prepare downgrade submission

Estimated time: 1–3 business days

Actions:
1. Draft the formal downgrade request letter and prepare the BI submission packet (cover letter, client IDs, copies of sponsor/employer documents if BI requests them).
2. Confirm any official BI fees and agent handling charges with the client.

Needed files:
- Completed submission packet
- Payment arrangement for agent/BI fees

### Step 3: File with Bureau of Immigration and monitor

Estimated time: 3–10 business days depending on BI workload

Actions:
1. Submit the packet to BI and pay official fees as required. Provide originals where BI asks to inspect and temporarily hold them.
2. Monitor BI processing, respond to BI queries, and update the client with progress.
3. When BI completes the downgrade, collect the passport and any endorsement and deliver them to the client.

Completion sign:
- Passport returned with tourist endorsement or BI written confirmation of status change.

Possible issues and mitigations:
- Missing 9G order → use 9G Order Copy Request (extra cost & time).
- BI identifies enforcement flags → escalate to legal or remediation workflow; inform client of additional steps and costs.

|---------------:|:--------:|------:|---------------------|------:|---------:|
| 2025-03 | PHP | 35,000 | Standard agent handling fee for 9G → tourist downgrade (applies to clients holding a 9G) | Quoted service fee; official BI fees not included | message 632568 |

Price notes:
- The agent handling fee (e.g. PHP 35,000) covers document preparation, BI submission and follow-up. Official BI fees, any DOJ or employer charges, courier and incidental costs are extra.
- If the 9G order must be retrieved or reissued, expect the additional PHP 4,500 and about one additional week processing time.

## Important notes / Risks

### Processing limitations
- BI retains full discretion to accept or deny a downgrade. Approval is not guaranteed.
- If the client's immigration file includes enforcement marks (OTL, blacklist, DERO flags), the downgrade may be denied or may trigger mandatory departure instructions.

### Time requirements
- Typical processing: 1–2 weeks with complete documents; add time if a 9G order copy is required.
- Plan travel only after BI official confirmation is returned; do not exit the country while files are pending without explicit advice.

### Risk warnings
- Mishandling the downgrade or missing material facts may result in BI issuing an Order to Leave (OTL) instead of permitting a tourist downgrade. Full disclosure of previous overstay or violations is required during intake.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: What documents do I absolutely need to start the downgrade?
A: Passport original, 9G I‑Card original and the BI 9G order (original or an authorised certified copy). Without the 9G order the downgrade cannot be filed.

Q: How long does it take and what does it cost?
A: Standard time is 1–2 weeks and the typical quoted agent fee is PHP 35,000. If we must retrieve a missing 9G order the extra service fee is PHP 4,500 and expect approximately one additional week.

Q: Will BI ever force me to leave instead of downgrading?
A: Yes — BI has discretion and in cases with adverse immigration history or unresolved enforcement items an OTL or similar enforcement action may be issued. We will highlight such risks during intake.
