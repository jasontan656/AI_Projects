# 9G Visa Stamp Transfer

## Summary

9G Visa Stamp Transfer is a Bureau of Immigration procedure to move an existing 9G-related passport endorsement (entry stamp and/or 9G visa endorsement) from an old passport to a newly issued passport. Typical clients are 9G visa holders who obtained a new national passport and need their valid immigration endorsements moved so they can travel and keep continuity of their BI record. This service handles the three-part operational workflow: (1) transfer of the entry/arrival stamp (entry record proof), (2) obtain a certified true copy (CTC) / BI order copy when needed, and (3) stamping the new passport with the 9G endorsement. The procedure requires strict BI documentation and, in many cases, the old passport must be formally cancelled or declared lost before the transfer can be accepted.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to use this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal (owner of the 9G record) or an authorised local representative must be physically available in the Philippines for submissions and for any in-person BI steps (some parts can be prepared remotely but BI will normally require originals or local attendance).
- Relationship prerequisite: The client must be the 9G visa holder (or an authorised representative with a signed authorization accepted by BI). Employer cooperation may be necessary for work-visa related endorsements.
- Business prerequisite: The old passport must be cancelled by the issuing authority or declared lost / permanently invalid per BI requirements when required by BI practice. BI enforces strict rules before transferring stamps between passports.

Not eligible:
- Cases where the BI record cannot be located and no certified copy can be produced or where the old passport cannot be shown or officially cancelled as required by BI.

## Required documents

### Documents the client must provide (cannot be produced by this service)

**Old passport (where the stamps currently reside)**
- Type: original × 1
- Requirement: The passport that contains the existing entry stamp and/or 9G endorsement. BI normally requires the old passport to be cancelled, surrendered, or supported by evidence of loss/cancellation before transfer will be accepted.
- How used: Inspected by BI and used as the source of stamps. May be temporarily retained by BI.

**New passport (recipient passport)**
- Type: original × 1
- Requirement: Valid national passport to receive the transferred entry stamp and/or visa endorsement. Must comply with passport validity and blank page requirements.
- How used: The new passport will be endorsed/updated with the transferred stamp when BI authorises the transfer.

### Documents that can be produced by other services (if client lacks them)

**Certified true copy (CTC) of the BI 9G order or BI records**
- Type: certified copy × 1
- Can be produced by: [9G Order Copy Request](BureauOfImmigration/9g-order-copy-request.md)
- How used: BI often requires a CTC of the original 9G order/BI record to validate a visa transfer or to support restamping in a new passport.

## Documents obtained after completion

**New passport with transferred entry stamp and/or 9G endorsement**
- Type: original passport with endorsement
- Use: The new passport will contain the official BI endorsement equivalent to the previous passport. Use for travel and as the official travel document going forward.
- Retention: Keep the passport safe. BI receipts and the CTC (if used) should also be retained for future reference.

**BI submission receipts and internal acknowledgement**
- Type: official BI receipt / acknowledgement
- Use: Proof that the transfer was requested, paid (if applicable), and processed.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Combined processing ranges from a few working days to several weeks depending on which sub-steps are required and BI workload.

### Step 1: Transfer entry/arrival stamp (if required)

**Estimated duration:** 2–3 working days (typical)

**Specific actions:**
1. Prepare an application for an Entry Record Proof or equivalent documentation used to move the entry/arrival stamp from the old passport to the new passport.
2. Submit the request to BI and include both the old and new passport copies and any supporting evidence that the old passport is cancelled or being retired.
3. Monitor BI and collect the official acknowledgement that the entry stamp can be transferred.

**Needed documents:**
- Old passport (original or certified copy)
- New passport (original)

**Notes:**
- BI practice on entry stamp transfer varies by case; obtaining the formal entry-record proof is the common first step.

### Step 2: Obtain certified true copy (CTC) of BI 9G order (if required)

**Estimated duration:** 7–10 working days (typical when a CTC is needed)

**Specific actions:**
1. If BI requires a certified true copy of the 9G order or BI record to proceed (for example when the visa endorsement is recorded as a BI order rather than a passport stamp), request the CTC from BI records.
2. If the client does not possess the original 9G order, use the [9G Order Copy Request](BureauOfImmigration/9g-order-copy-request.md) service to obtain the official certified copy.
3. Provide the CTC to the stamping unit as required by BI.

**Completion sign:** A BI-certified copy of the 9G order is issued or confirmed available.

### Step 3: Transfer work visa stamp / restamping into the new passport

**Estimated duration:** 5–15 working days (typical)

**Specific actions:**
1. Submit the new passport, the old passport (or proof of cancellation/loss), and the BI CTC (if required) to the BI stamping unit to request the visa endorsement transfer.
2. Pay any official BI fees and service fees as applicable.
3. Monitor BI and collect the new passport once BI finishes the endorsement. Verify the stamp and return documentation.

**Needed documents:**
- New passport (original)
- Old passport (original or evidence of cancellation/loss)
- BI CTC (if BI required)

**Possible issues and mitigation:**
- If BI cannot locate the original 9G record, obtain the official CTC first via the 9G Order Copy Request service.
- If old passport is not cancelled or BI policy differs, the transfer may be refused; follow BI instructions for alternate remediation (for example restamping using CTC).

## Important notes and risks

- BI enforces strict requirements for stamp transfers. In many cases the old passport must be formally cancelled or declared lost before BI will transfer stamps to a new passport.
- If the old passport or BI order cannot be located, the process requires retrieval of a certified true copy (CTC) of the BI order; this adds time and cost.
- Original documents are usually required and are commonly retained by BI during processing; clients should plan travel and make contingency arrangements.
- Restamping or transfer does not alter visa validity; it only moves the recorded endorsement to the new passport. Confirm validity dates after transfer.
