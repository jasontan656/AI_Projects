# 9G I-Card Release

## Summary

The 9G I-Card Release service handles the final physical handover of a Bureau of Immigration (BI) issued 9G I-Card and its corresponding receipt to the cardholder or an authorized representative. Typical users are principals who already completed the 9G application process and are ready to receive their printed I-Card, or employers/agents who collect the card on the principal's behalf. The service verifies identity and authorization at pickup, confirms no additional payment is due at release when applicable, documents the handover, and returns custody where required.

---

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to use this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The cardholder or an authorized local representative must be physically present at the agreed pickup location (agent office or designated collection point) in the Philippines.
- Relationship prerequisite: If a representative collects the I-Card, the representative must present a written authorization signed by the principal and valid IDs for both principal and representative.
- Business prerequisite: The I-Card must have already been issued by BI and be in the agent's possession or available for pickup from the designated release point.

Not eligible:
- Cases where the I-Card is still in production at BI and has not yet been released.
- Situations where BI requires the holder's mandatory in-person biometrics/photo at collection and the holder cannot attend (unless BI explicitly permits representation).

## Required documents

### Documents the client (or representative) must provide

- Pickup authorization (if an authorized representative collects):
  - Type: original signed authorization × 1
  - Requirement: Legible signed letter authorizing the named representative to collect the I-Card on behalf of the principal. Must include principal name, passport number, and representative name.
  - How used: Agent verifies authorization before releasing the I-Card. Authorization is retained as part of the release record.

- Representative's valid government-issued ID:
  - Type: original × 1
  - Requirement: Photo ID showing name and signature (passport, national ID, or driver's license). The ID is verified against the authorization and retained for record.

- Principal's ID or proof of identity (if available at pickup):
  - Type: copy or original × 1
  - Requirement: Passport bio page or BI reference to cross-check the issued I-Card.

Notes: If the principal collects personally, present the passport or national ID used in the BI application. Agent must verify identity and obtain signature on the release receipt.

### Documents produced by other services (if client lacks them)

- 9G I-Card (original): produced by BI after 9G application processes (for example: 2 Year 9G Work Visa, 3 Year 9G Work Visa, or 9G Application services).
- Release receipt (original): generated by the releasing agent at the time of handover.

---

## Documents obtained after completion

- 9G I-Card (original): the physical immigration identification card issued by BI and delivered to the cardholder (or authorized representative) at pickup.
  - Can be used for: Employment-related processes (AEP, employer compliance), travel identification as permitted, and as the holder's BI ID for future BI transactions.
  - Retention: Cardholder must keep the card in secure custody; replacement is possible via the I-Card replacement service if lost/damaged.

- Release receipt (original): signed proof that the agent delivered the I-Card to the named recipient.
  - Use: Evidence of handover; retained by both agent and cardholder for future reference.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Usually same-day at the pickup appointment, subject to agent office hours and coordination.

### Step 1: Prepare the I-Card for release

**Estimated duration:** same day (pre-arranged)

Specific actions:
1. Confirm the I-Card has been produced and is available for release (check BI release notice or internal tracking).
2. Print and prepare a release receipt that lists the cardholder name, passport number, BI reference (if any), date of issuance, and the pickup representative (if applicable).
3. Store the card securely until the scheduled pickup.

**Required documents:** internal release receipt, I-Card in secure storage

**Note:** If the source evidence records the card was already given to the principal (example case), update the internal status to 'released' and record evidence.

---

### Step 2: Coordinate pickup with the recipient or representative

**Estimated duration:** same day to 2 business days (depends on scheduling)

Specific actions:
1. Confirm pickup time and location with the cardholder or their authorized representative (for example: Velaa Group representative).
2. Request and verify the representative's authorization letter and valid ID prior to the appointment.
3. Remind the recipient that no further payment is required at pickup unless otherwise communicated; collect any outstanding handling fee only if previously agreed.

**Completion sign:** Appointment confirmed and identity/authorization documents received or expected.

---

### Step 3: Release the I-Card and obtain signatures

**Estimated duration:** minutes at pickup

Specific actions:
1. Verify recipient identity and authorization: check authorization letter, compare IDs, and confirm principal name and passport number match the released I-Card.
2. Present the I-Card and the official receipt to the recipient for inspection.
3. Have the recipient (principal or representative) sign the agent's release receipt acknowledging physical receipt of the I-Card and receipt.
4. Provide copies of the signed release receipt to the recipient and retain an archived copy in the agent's case file.

**Required documents:** pickup authorization (if applicable), representative ID, release receipt

**Completion sign:** Signed receipt on file and I-Card physically transferred.

**Potential issues:**
- If ID or authorization is insufficient, withhold release and request additional verification from the principal (for example, a notarized authorization or live confirmation via recorded call).
- If BI later requests additional documentation at the time of pickup, advise the recipient on next steps and do not release until BI instructions are satisfied.

## Price & Fees

| Effective Date | Currency | Amount | Applicable Conditions | Notes | Evidence |
| 2025-10-17 | PHP | 0 | Standard pickup when no outstanding agent balance or BI fee is due at release | No payment required upon handover unless prior agreement states otherwise | message 623005 |

Price notes:
- The agent's handling fee for release is normally included in the prior service quote for the 9G application or card production. If separate handling fees apply for physical pickup, these must be agreed and paid in advance or clearly documented prior to release.

---

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Release limitations
- The I-Card must be in the agent's custody or at an agreed secure pickup location before release. If BI has not yet produced or released the card, this service cannot proceed.
- Where BI requires the principal's in-person appearance at release (rare), the authorized representative will not be permitted to collect the card.

### Identity & authorization requirements
- Agents must verify ID and written authorizations. If required documents are missing or suspicious, the agent must refuse release and escalate to the principal for resolution.

### Record-keeping
- Maintain a signed release receipt and a digital scan/case note documenting the release date/time, recipient identity, and any special instructions. This protects both the agent and the client from later disputes.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Who can pick up the I-Card on my behalf?
A: A named authorized representative may pick up the I-Card if they present a signed authorization letter from the principal and a valid government ID. The agent will verify details before release.

Q: Do I need to pay anything at pickup?
A: Normally no. If there is a previously agreed handling fee outstanding, the agent will have recorded this and will require payment as agreed. The evidence for the example case records "No payment required upon pickup." (see Evidence below).

Q: What happens if someone else received my I-Card without authorization?
A: Immediately notify the agent and BI. The agent will review its release records and assist in escalation; legal remedies may be necessary if misdelivery occurred.
