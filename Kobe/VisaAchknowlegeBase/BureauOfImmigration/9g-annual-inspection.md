# 9G Annual Inspection

## Summary

The 9G Annual Inspection is an annual administrative check for holders of the BI 9G employer-sponsored work visa. Cardholders must perform a yearly inspection/registration with the Bureau of Immigration (BI) to confirm the validity of their I-Card and immigration record. The process typically includes an online registration step, presenting the passport and I-Card (or copies), paying official fees and a small service fee, and completing a photo/identity confirmation. Failure to complete the annual inspection may result in penalties. This document describes prerequisites, required documents, step-by-step process, fees, risks and supporting evidence extracted from chat records.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to request the 9G Annual Inspection service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The cardholder must be physically present in the Philippines for any in-person steps (photo capture / BI counter attendance) unless BI explicitly accepts an authorised representative for a specific step.
- Relationship prerequisite: The requester must be the 9G visa holder or an authorised representative with a signed authorization accepted by BI.
- Business prerequisite: The client must have a valid passport and the 9G I-Card (or evidence of the 9G order) available at intake. If the I-Card is missing, related services (for example I-Card replacement or order-copy retrieval) must be completed first.

Not eligible:
- Persons outside the Philippines who cannot attend required in-person steps where BI requires the principal.
- Cases with unresolved enforcement flags (OTL, blacklist, DERO) that require remediation before a routine annual inspection can be accepted.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Usually same-day to a few hours for the on-site steps; allow additional time for online registration and processing depending on BI queue.

### Step 1: Online registration

**Estimated duration:** 5–30 minutes

**Specific actions:**
1. Complete the BI online or designated registration form and submit the requested details (name, passport number, I-Card number).
2. Upload required scans (passport bio page, I-Card front/back) as instructed.
3. Receive a registration confirmation or QR code that indicates the registration slot or payment reference.

**Required documents:**
- Passport bio page scan
- I-Card front/back scan

**Notes:**
- Save the registration confirmation or QR code for the in-person visit and payment.

### Step 2: In-person payment and photo/verification

**Estimated duration:** 15–60 minutes (depends on queue)

**Specific actions:**
1. Present the registration confirmation/QR code, original passport and I-Card (or copies if permitted) at the designated BI counter or payment location.
2. Pay the official BI fee and any local processing charge that BI requires.
3. Have an on-site photograph taken if BI requires a fresh capture during the annual inspection.
4. Obtain the BI-issued acknowledgement or official receipt.

**Required documents:**
- Passport original
- I-Card original (or copy if allowed)
- Registration confirmation/QR code

**Completion sign:**
- Receipt or acknowledgement issued by BI confirming the annual inspection is recorded.

### Step 3: Agent service closing (optional)

**Estimated duration:** same day

**Specific actions:**
1. If the client purchased the agent service, the agent logs the BI receipt, issues the internal payment confirmation, and updates the client record.
2. Deliver scanned copies of BI receipts and confirm case closure.

**Possible issues & mitigation:**
- If BI requests additional documents (for example proof of employment or original 9G order), the agent notifies the client and assists in collecting required materials.

## Price & Fees

| Effective Date | Currency | Amount | Applicable Conditions | Notes | Evidence |
|---------------:|:-------:|------:|----------------------|------|---------:|
| 2025-01 | PHP | 500 | Agent service fee per person | Private service/handling fee charged by the agent to assist with registration/coordination | message 609383 |
| 2025-01 | PHP | 310 | BI official fee (example extracted) | Bureau of Immigration counter fee reported in chat evidence as additional government charge | message 609383 |
| 2025-01 | PHP | 2,000 (penalty) | Annual non-compliance penalty (per year) | Reported penalty amount for failing to perform the annual inspection on time | message 610620 |

**Price notes:**
- The agent's service fee (PHP 500) is separate from BI official fees. Confirm the current BI schedule at intake. The penalty amount (PHP 2,000 per year) was reported in chat evidence and should be verified against BI official notices before action.

---

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Reporting limits
- The principal is normally required to attend in person for any photo or biometric capture. Some BI counters accept authorised representatives for limited actions but confirm in advance.

### Timing requirements
- Annual inspection is usually scheduled early in the calendar year; follow BI scheduling to avoid penalties. Late compliance may trigger the reported penalty (~PHP 2,000 per year as cited in chat evidence).

### Risks
- Failure to perform annual inspection can trigger administrative penalties and may complicate future BI transactions.
- If required originals (passport or I-Card) are missing, additional procedures (I-Card replacement or order copy retrieval) will be necessary and will delay completion.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need an agent to complete the 9G annual inspection?**
A: No — many cardholders can complete the online registration and attend the BI counter themselves. An agent can assist with document preparation, online registration, and in-person follow-up for a service fee.

**Q: What happens if I miss the annual inspection?**
A: Evidence from chat records indicates a penalty (reported ~PHP 2,000 per year). You should contact BI or an agent to regularize your record as soon as possible.

**Q: Will the annual inspection affect my travel?**
A: The annual inspection is an administrative maintenance requirement and does not prevent travel. However, if the BI record shows non-compliance or enforcement flags, it may affect future BI interactions.
