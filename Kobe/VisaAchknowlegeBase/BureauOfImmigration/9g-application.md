# 9G Application

## Summary

The 9G Application is the process of filing for a 9G working visa (BI-issued work visa) for foreign nationals employed or sponsored by a Philippine-based employer. This service covers document collection, preparation of the Bureau of Immigration (BI) submission packet, scheduling and coordination of biometric/fingerprint capture where required, payment handling (deposit + final), monitoring of BI processing, and secure return/delivery of the passport and issued 9G I-Card. Typical users are foreign employees sponsored by a local company who need a 1–3 year employer-sponsored work authorization.

---

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to request the 9G Application service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The applicant must be available in the Philippines for BI biometric capture and document submission steps that require in-person attendance. Some advisory work may be done remotely, but core BI steps are local.
- Relationship prerequisite: There must be a sponsoring employer or local entity supporting the 9G application (employer-based sponsorship is required in practice).
- Business prerequisite: Applicant must have a valid passport and any prerequisite work permits where applicable (for example a formal AEP for certain 3-year 9G filings).

Not eligible:
- Applicants outside the Philippines who cannot attend mandatory biometric capture and who cannot provide acceptable authorized representation where BI requires the applicant to appear.

## Required documents (client must provide)

### Passport
- Type: original × 1
- Requirement: Valid passport with sufficient remaining validity and blank pages for endorsement. Passport will typically be borrowed by BI during processing and returned upon release.
- Use: Identity verification, submission to BI, and I-Card issuance.

### Alien Employment Permit (AEP) card
- Type: original × 1 (when applicable)
- Requirement: Required for 3-year 9G applications and commonly necessary for employer-sponsored filings. The AEP must be issued and available before the BI will accept certain 9G applications.
- Use: Core eligibility evidence for BI submission.

Notes: Additional employer documents (company registration, employment contract, sponsor letters) are often required by BI; agent will request the precise employer package during intake.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Variable depending on BI workload and case complexity. Typical timelines vary from weeks to a few months depending on visa duration (2-year vs 3-year), biometric scheduling, and document completeness.

### Step 1: Intake and eligibility check

**Estimated duration:** Same day — 1 business day

Specific actions:
1. Collect client's basic personal details and employer sponsorship information.
2. Confirm required documents are available (passport and AEP where applicable).
3. Provide a service quote and payment schedule (deposit + balance) and explain biometric attendance requirement.

**Needed documents:** passport copy, employer sponsor details, AEP if already issued.

**Notes:** The agent will not file the BI packet until prerequisite documents (notably AEP for 3-year filings) are confirmed available.

---

### Step 2: Prepare submission packet and schedule biometric

**Estimated duration:** 1–7 days depending on appointment availability

Specific actions:
1. Complete BI application forms and compile supporting employer documents.
2. Schedule BI biometric/fingerprint appointment (applicant attendance normally required).
3. Collect the deposit payment to confirm booking where agent policy requires a deposit.

**Needed documents:** passport original, any employer documents requested by BI.

---

### Step 3: Biometric capture and formal submission

**Estimated duration:** Appointment day; queue time varies

Specific actions:
1. Applicant attends BI for fingerprints/biometrics as scheduled.
2. Submit the complete packet to the BI office and pay official BI fees (agent handles payment where agreed).
3. Obtain BI submission receipt and note any reference numbers for monitoring.

**Completion sign:** BI issues submission receipt and confirms biometric capture was completed.

---

### Step 4: Monitoring, final payment and delivery

**Estimated duration:** Weeks to months depending on BI processing

Specific actions:
1. Monitor BI case progress and respond to additional BI requests for evidence.
2. Collect final payment from client when BI requests balance payment for card production or issuance.
3. When BI issues the 9G I-Card and endorses the passport, arrange secure delivery or client pickup and close the case.

**Completion sign:** Client receives passport and 9G I-Card and confirms receipt.

## Important notes / Restrictions

- AEP requirement: Ensure that the AEP card is issued and released before filing for certain 9G variants (notably multi-year 3-year 9G). Filing attempts without a valid AEP may be rejected.
- Passport custody: BI commonly borrows original passports during processing and returns them upon release; clients should plan travel accordingly.
- Biometric attendance: Applicant typically must attend biometric/fingerprint capture in person. If BI permits representation for specific steps, the agent will advise and prepare authorization templates.
- Regular updates: Keep the client informed at key milestones (biometric scheduled, final payment requested, issuance ready).

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need an AEP to apply for 9G?**
A: A formal AEP is generally required for certain 9G variants (e.g., 3-year 9G) and is commonly requested by BI as prerequisite evidence. Confirm AEP requirements during intake for your specific application.

**Q: Will my passport be held by BI?**
A: Yes — immigration often holds the passport during processing. We will record custody and expected return timelines and notify you when passport is ready for collection.

**Q: How much does the 9G application cost?**
A: Costs vary. Example chat evidence records case-specific payments such as PHP 99,900 for one client (message 357524). Standard package quotes for 2-year and 3-year 9G services are recorded in separate KB entries (see related businesses) and must be confirmed at intake.
