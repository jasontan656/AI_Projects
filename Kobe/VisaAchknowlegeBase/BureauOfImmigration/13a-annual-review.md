# 13A Annual Review

## Summary

The 13A Annual Review is an administrative yearly check required for holders of 13A classification. It is typically scheduled annually (commonly in March) and requires the cardholder's in-person attendance at the Bureau of Immigration for a photograph, completion of immigration forms, and payment of any applicable fees. This is a standalone, simple procedure: most clients can complete it directly at the immigration window without agent assistance.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to undergo the 13A Annual Review:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal (the 13A holder) must be physically present in the Philippines for the in-person photo and form submission.
- Relationship prerequisite: Applicable only insofar as the holder must be the person who holds 13A classification (for example, foreign spouse of a Filipino citizen).
- Business prerequisite: The client must hold a valid passport and the current 13A I-Card (or documentation explaining loss) at the time of review.

Not eligible:
- Persons located outside the Philippines who cannot attend in person and for whom Bureau of Immigration does not accept representation for the annual review.

## Required documents (must be provided by client)

The following items must be provided by the client and cannot be produced by this service on behalf of the client:

- Passport:
  - Type: original × 1
  - Requirements: Valid passport presented for identity verification. The passport may be temporarily taken for verification per BI practice and returned after completion.
  - Use: Identification during the annual review.

- 13A I-Card (current):
  - Type: original × 1
  - Requirements: Present the existing I-Card if available. If the card is lost, provide a police report or affidavit of loss if required by BI.
  - Use: Evidence of 13A classification; used for verification and record.

- Completed BI annual review form (filled on site):
  - Type: original (form provided by BI) × 1
  - Requirements: Typically completed at the immigration window during the appointment or walk-in.

Notes: Clients should arrive prepared to present identity documents and the 13A I-Card. If a document is missing (for example I-Card lost), BI may require additional supporting documents which the client must obtain prior to or during the review.

## Documents that can be produced by our services

- Authorization template for representative (if BI permits representation):
  - Type: copy / template
  - Producer: 13A Annual Review
  - Path: BureauOfImmigration/13a-annual-review.md
  - Usage: Used when a permitted authorized representative will attend instead of the principal.

Note: Source evidence indicates this business usually requires the principal to attend in person and "no assistance is necessary."

  - Type: official receipt or administrative acknowledgement (original/copy)
  - Use: Proof that the annual review was performed; may be requested by BI or other agencies as proof of compliance.

## Price & Fees

No fixed agent service fee is recorded in the source evidence. Official Bureau of Immigration fees (if any) apply and are payable directly to BI at the time of the annual review. Service providers may charge a handling fee if the client requests representation or assistance.

**Price notes:**
- The annual review is typically a low-cost administrative action; check BI for the current official fee schedule.
- If the client requests an agent to attend or to prepare supporting documents, a separate service fee will apply.

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Processing limitations
- The principal typically must be physically present for the photograph and form completion; representation may not be accepted in all cases.
- If the 13A I-Card is missing, BI may require additional documentation (police report or affidavit) which can delay the annual review.

### Timing requirements
- Yearly timing: Common practice places many annual reviews in March, but clients should follow BI scheduling and instructions.
- Arrive early and confirm current BI procedures and any appointment requirements.

### Risks
- Failure to complete the annual review on schedule may lead to administrative queries or penalties from BI.
- If required original documents are missing, the review may be postponed.
