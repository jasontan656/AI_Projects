# 9G Visa Blacklist Handling

## Summary

This service addresses cases where a 9G employer-sponsored work visa holder is flagged on a Bureau of Immigration (BI) blacklist or related enforcement/DERO records. The service performs a targeted diagnostics sequence (ICard status check, employer/company identity verification, blacklist/DERO status check) and then, where feasible, obtains the authoritative BI blacklist/order copy and crafts a remediation path. Typical users are principals who find they cannot leave or re-enter, or whose visa processing is blocked because of a blacklist flag. The deliverables are a case assessment report, authoritative BI status confirmations (ICard/order copy), and recommended remediation steps (for example appeal, order retrieval or paid settlement if required).

---

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet these prerequisites before we can handle a blacklist case:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal or an authorised local representative should be in the Philippines when in-person steps are required by BI (for example to produce an original I-Card or for archival record retrieval). Remote diagnosis is possible but authoritative order copies often require local action.
- Relationship prerequisite: The requester must be the visa holder (principal) or an authorised representative (employer/agent) with written authorization accepted by BI or our office.
- Business prerequisite: The client must provide identity evidence sufficient to locate BI records (passport number, full name as on passport, and any BI submission/receipt references if available).

Not eligible:
- Cases with incomplete identity information where BI cannot locate a matching record.
- Cases that require legal proceedings (court appeals) outside operational BI/DOJ remediation — these will be escalated to immigration counsel.

## Required documents

### Documents the client must provide (must be provided by the client)

- Passport bio page (copy)
  - Type: copy × 1
  - Required: Yes
  - Requirements: Clear scan or photo of the passport biographical page. Used to query BI systems and to confirm identity when retrieving BI records.
  - Use: Identity verification. Non-consumable (returned to client).

- 9G I-Card (copy or original if available)
  - Type: copy × 1 (original when BI requires inspection)
  - Required: Preferable but not mandatory. If provided, it speeds record matching and may avoid some paid lookups.
  - Use: Helps confirm BI record details; if original is provided and BI or records office needs to inspect it, we will coordinate custody with the client.

- Employer / company name and sponsor details
  - Type: information or supporting documentation (company name, employer TIN, AEP details)
  - Required: Yes — if the blacklist is employer-related or name-based, accurate sponsor details help disambiguate records and may reduce lookup costs.

Optional but helpful:
- Any prior BI submission receipts, claim stubs or group-thread references that include BI reference numbers.

### Documents the service can produce or obtain

- BI I-Card status report (producer: this service)
  - Document: authoritative status note indicating whether an active I-Card exists in BI records
  - Path: BureauOfImmigration/9g-visa-status-check.md

- BI Blacklist / Order copy (producer: 9G Order Copy Request)
  - Document: certified copy or scanned extract of the BI order that generated the blacklist/DERO flag
  - Path: BureauOfImmigration/9g-order-copy-request.md

- Case assessment and remediation plan (producer: this service)
  - Document: a one-page assessment describing findings, required payments (if any), and recommended next steps.

## Outcome / Deliverables

Upon completion the client receives:

- Case Assessment Report:
  - Type: PDF report (producer: 9G Visa Blacklist Handling)
  - Content: summary of BI status, whether the person is on a blacklist/DERO/other enforcement lists, recommended next steps.

- Verification outputs (if available):
  - I-Card status confirmation (scan/case note)
  - Certified copy of the BI order that caused the blacklist (if retrievable)

- Remediation recommendations: specific actions and links to follow-up services (for example: pay fines, request rescind, apply for order copy, downgrade process, legal counsel referral).

## Process / Steps

**Estimated total turnaround:** same-day to 7 business days depending on BI responsiveness and whether order copy retrieval is required.

### Step 1 — Intake & quick status check (diagnostic)

**Estimated duration:** same day (hours)

**Actions:**
1. Collect passport bio page, I-Card copy (if available), and sponsor/employer details.
2. Perform a rapid status check via internal channels or the BI status check workflow to confirm whether the person is recorded as 9G and whether a blacklist/DERO flag appears.

**Documents needed:** passport copy, sponsor info

**Completion sign:** Initial BI status recorded (9G vs 9A vs not found) and a recommendation whether to escalate for an order copy retrieval.

**Notes:** Providing the original I-Card or accurate employer name may avoid paid lookups.

### Step 2 — Disambiguation and company-name verification

**Estimated duration:** same day to 2 business days

**Actions:**
1. If multiple BI records share the same name, perform company/sponsor name verification to disambiguate, or request supporting documents from the client to match the correct record.
2. If the record is ambiguous, advise the client on additional documents required (for example employer letter, AEP copy) to avoid retrieving the wrong order.

**Completion sign:** Correct BI file identity established or identification gap documented.

### Step 3 — Blacklist check and order retrieval decision

**Estimated duration:** 1–5 business days (depending on whether a formal order copy request is required)

**Actions:**
1. If the initial check confirms a flag, recommend either a paid order-copy retrieval (to see the authoritative order text) or proceed to remedial inquiry if the client has evidence (for example proof of fine payment).
2. If the client authorises retrieval, initiate the 9G Order Copy Request process and collect the retrieval fee.

**Costs & decision logic:**
- If client provides employer docs that identify the record uniquely, the order copy step may be unnecessary and fees can be saved.
- If no unique identifiers exist, retrieving the order copy avoids mistaken remediation and is recommended.

**Completion sign:** Certified order copy obtained or retrieval attempt documented.

### Step 4 — Remediation planning and closure

**Estimated duration:** same day to a few days after obtaining order copy

**Actions:**
1. Review order text to determine the cause (overstay fine, OTL, deportation, DERO flag) and map the required remedial actions (pay fines, file appeal, request rescind, coordinate ECC/downgrade).
2. Provide a written remediation plan and quotes for any follow-up services (for example fine payment, 9G downgrade, ECC filing, legal counsel). If the client approves, schedule the next service.

**Completion sign:** Client receives final report and a clear next-step quote or referral.

## Price & Fees

| Effective Date | Currency | Amount | Applicable Conditions | Notes |
| 2024-07 | PHP | 1500 | I-Card status check | If client supplies I-Card details or sponsor details, this fee may be waived | 
| 2024-07 | PHP | 1500 | Blacklist check | Basic blacklist lookup via available channels | 
| 2024-07 | PHP | 4500 | Retrieve BI blacklist/order copy | Charged when a certified BI order copy must be requested from BI records | 

**Price notes:**
- The prices above were extracted from operational chat evidence and are quoted as agent service fees. Any official government fees (if BI charges for certified copies) are additional and billed separately.
- If the client provides accurate sponsor and I-Card information, some of the above checks may be unnecessary and fees can be reduced.

---

## Important notes / Risks

- Presence: Some authoritative record retrievals or identity confirmations require the client (or authorised representative) to be physically present in the Philippines.
- Ambiguity: Identical names are common. Providing employer and passport details reduces the risk of retrieving the wrong order.
- Outcome uncertainty: Not all blacklist flags are removable. Some flags require payment, legal steps, or BI adjudication. This service produces assessment and remediation options, not guaranteed removal.

## Common Questions (FAQ)

Q: What exactly do you check when you "check the I-Card status"?
A: We confirm whether BI records show an active I-Card associated with the passport number or name, and whether any enforcement flags (DERO, blacklist, OTL) appear in accessible status channels.

Q: How long does it take to get the BI order copy?
A: Typical operational time is 1–5 business days depending on BI records workload and whether additional identification is required.

Q: Can you remove a blacklist flag for me?
A: Removal depends on the specific reason recorded in the BI order. Possible remedies include fine payment, appeal, or administrative clearance. We provide the remediation plan and can perform the remedial actions upon client instruction.
