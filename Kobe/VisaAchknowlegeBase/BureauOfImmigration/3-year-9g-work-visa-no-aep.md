# 3 Year 9G Work Visa (No AEP)

## Summary

This service arranges a 3-year 9G work visa filing that, according to the source evidence, is processed without a formal DOLE AEP card as an input (a no-AEP variant). Typical clients are employer-sponsored foreign employees whose case can be filed based on available immigration and visa history (previous visas/orders) rather than a current AEP. The service handles document collection, BI submission, biometric coordination where required, payment management (deposit + balance), monitoring of the Bureau of Immigration (BI) process, and secure return/delivery of the passport and 9G I-Card or passport endorsement.

This no-AEP variant differs from the standard 3-year 9G workflow (which normally requires a formal AEP) and may be available only in specific operational contexts depending on BI practice and sponsor acceptance.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions before we can handle this no-AEP 3-year 9G filing:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal (applicant) or an authorized local representative must be physically available in the Philippines for any BI steps that require in-person attendance (notably biometric/fingerprint capture).
- Relationship prerequisite: There must be an employer sponsor or local entity willing to support the 9G application and provide required employer documents when requested by BI.
- Business prerequisite: Client must have a valid passport and accessible previous visa documentation (previous BI order, prior visa pages, or prior I-Card). In the no-AEP scenario the prior immigration evidence is the key input.

Not eligible:
- Applicants outside the Philippines who cannot attend mandatory BI biometric appointments when BI requires personal attendance.
- Cases where BI explicitly requires a current AEP as a legal prerequisite for a 3-year filing (policy may change; confirm at intake).

## Required documents

### Documents the client must provide (cannot be produced by this service)

**Passport:**
- Type: original × 1
- Requirement: Valid passport presented for verification and for submission. The passport will typically be borrowed during BI processing and returned after release.
- Use: Identity and submission to BI.

**Previous visa / BI order documentation:**
- Type: copy / original where available × 1
- Requirement: Passport visa pages showing prior BI endorsements, previous 9G order copy (if available), or prior immigration receipts proving the client's prior BI record.
- Use: Core evidence used in lieu of an AEP for this variant; must be genuine and match BI records.

Notes: Originals are typically borrowed by BI during processing and returned upon release. If required records cannot be located, we will recommend the related service to retrieve a certified copy of the BI order before filing.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Source evidence reports an approximate turnaround of about 1 month for this specific no-AEP variant. Actual BI processing time remains subject to BI workload and policy.

### Step 1: Intake and document collection

**Estimated duration:** 1–3 business days

1. Collect passport and previous visa/BI documentation from the client (scan and/or original as required).
2. Verify that the client's prior visa records are sufficient to attempt a no-AEP 3-year filing. If key records are missing, advise and initiate retrieval of a certified 9G order copy if needed.
3. Provide service quote and obtain deposit (see Price & Fees).

**Needed documents:** passport original, previous visa documentation.

**Notes:** If the BI requires a formal AEP for a particular case, the no-AEP route cannot proceed; we will advise the client accordingly.

---

### Step 2: Prepare the BI submission packet and payment schedule

**Estimated duration:** 1–3 business days

1. Complete BI application forms and assemble the submission packet using prior-visa evidence as the core eligibility proof.
2. Collect the deposit (evidence indicates an 80% deposit practice in this operational stream) and schedule BI biometric where required.
3. Confirm whether an in-person biometric appointment is required for the applicant and schedule accordingly.

**Notes:** Source evidence mentions that an 80% deposit is normally collected and that there is an operational option: "if processing time is under 5 working days, we can file first and collect balance later" — confirm case-by-case.

---

### Step 3: Biometric capture at BI (fingerprint)

**Estimated duration:** Appointment day (minutes to an hour)

1. Attend the BI appointment to have fingerprints/biometrics captured if BI requires the applicant to appear.
2. Obtain confirmation/acknowledgement of biometric capture.

**Completion sign:** BI confirms biometric registration was completed for the application.

---

### Step 4: Final payment and issuance

**Estimated duration:** Variable (BI processing time)

1. When BI requests the final payment, collect the balance from the client and process payment as instructed.
2. Monitor BI processing; when BI issues the 9G I-Card or passport endorsement, arrange secure delivery of the passport and I-Card to the client.

**Completion sign:** Client receives passport and 9G I-Card and confirms receipt.

## Price & Fees

| Effective Date | Currency | Amount | Applicable Conditions | Notes |
|---------------:|:--------:|-------:|---------------------|------:|
| 2023-09 | PHP | 110,000 | Quoted agent/service price for a 3-year no-AEP 9G filing | Source evidence: chat messages confirming price; deposit structure commonly 80% then balance on completion | message 465722, 473405 |

**Price explanation:**
- The quoted total fee in the source evidence is PHP 110,000. Operational practice commonly collects an 80% deposit to start the process and the balance upon BI progress or issuance. Official BI fees, DOLE fees (if any), courier and biometric fees are charged separately and are not included unless explicitly agreed.

---

## Important notes / Risks

### Processing limitations
- Even where a no-AEP filing was previously accepted operationally, BI policy can change; confirm at intake whether BI still accepts a no-AEP 3-year filing for the client’s nationality and case specifics.
- BI retains discretion: a no-AEP filing may be rejected if BI requires an AEP for a 3-year endorsement at time of adjudication.

### Time & payment rules
- Timelines are subject to BI workload. Source evidence reported typical handling time about one month for this variant, but timelines vary.
- The agent typically requests an 80% deposit to start. If BI processing is exceptionally fast (for example under 5 working days), the agent may accept a different payment arrangement (file first, collect balance later) — clarify at intake.

### Biometric requirement
- BI may require the applicant to attend in person for fingerprint/biometric capture; plan around the scheduled appointment.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What is the difference between this no-AEP 3-year 9G and the standard 3-year 9G with AEP?**
A: The standard multi-year 9G filing normally requires a formal DOLE AEP as a prerequisite. The no-AEP variant relies on prior BI records and sponsor support rather than a current AEP; it is situational and depends on BI acceptance.

**Q: What documents do I absolutely need to provide?**
A: A valid passport (original) and your prior visa / BI documentation (previous 9G order, prior 9G I-Card, or prior BI receipts). These are the inputs relied upon instead of an AEP.

**Q: How long does it take?**
A: Source evidence reports about one month for this variant. Actual BI processing may be faster or slower depending on BI workload and case details.
