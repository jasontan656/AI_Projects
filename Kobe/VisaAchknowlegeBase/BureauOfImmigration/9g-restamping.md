# 9G Restamping

## Summary

9G Restamping is the administrative process to obtain a corrected or newly applied stamp/endorsement for an existing 9G work visa record in the Bureau of Immigration (BI) passport/visa pages. Typical customers are holders of an existing BI 9G visa who require an official restamp (for example to correct a missing stamp, to reissue a visa stamp after an administrative update, or to replace an invalid-looking stamp). The core requirement is a certified true copy (CTC) of the 9G visa record obtained from the BI records section — original external CTCs or recreated stamps are not accepted due to concerns about fake stamps. This service helps clients obtain the necessary certified copy from BI records and submits the copy to the appropriate stamping/endorsement unit for restamping.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions before we can handle 9G Restamping:

- Geographic prerequisite: The client or an authorised local representative must be physically present in the Philippines when BI requires originals or in-person submission. Some parts of the intake can be started remotely (scans), but the records retrieval and stamp endorsement generally require local action.
- Relationship prerequisite: The requester must be the 9G visa holder (principal) or an authorised representative with a signed authorization. Employer HR may act where properly authorised.
- Business prerequisite: The client must have an existing 9G visa record in BI (for example prior BI order or an I-Card reference). If the underlying 9G record cannot be located by BI, restamping cannot proceed until the record is located or re-created via the appropriate BI process.

Not eligible:
- Cases where BI cannot locate any 9G record for the principal.
- Cases where the stamp issue relates to a different visa classification that requires a separate BI procedure (for example new visa issuance rather than restamping of an existing 9G endorsement).

## Required documents

### Documents the client must provide (cannot be produced by this service)

**9G Visa CTC (Certified True Copy from BI records):**
- Type: copy × 1
- Requirement: Must be an official certified true copy issued by BI's record section (Record Section / Archive). External originals or copies not produced by the BI records office are not accepted.
- How used: Submitted to the stamping/endorsement unit as the authoritative evidence for restamping.
- Handling: Borrowed and returned where BI policy allows. In practice the CTC is obtained from the record section and handed to the stamping unit.

**Passport (bio page and visa pages):**
- Type: original × 1 (presented for verification; may be temporarily held by BI during endorsement)
- Requirement: Valid passport that will receive the stamp or endorsement.

**Proof of identity / authorization (if representative acts):**
- Type: copy/original as required × 1
- Requirement: Signed authorization letter and ID of representative when the client is not attending personally.

### Documents that can be produced by our services

**9G Order Copy (where available):**
- Type: copy (scanned PDF)
- Producer: 9G Order Copy Request
- Path: BureauOfImmigration/9g-order-copy-request.md
- Usage: If the client lacks the certified copy, our related service may assist to locate and request an official copy from BI files. Note: final CTC must be issued/verified by the BI record section per BI rules.

## Documents obtained after completion

**Restamped 9G visa endorsement (passport stamp or BI endorsement):**
- Type: original (passport endorsement) × 1
- Can be used for: travel, employer compliance, AEP processing, and other downstream immigration tasks that require a valid 9G endorsement.
- Custody: Passport will be returned to the client after BI releases the restamped endorsement.
- Validity: As per the existing 9G record — restamping does not extend visa validity; it only corrects or re-affirms the existing endorsement.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Typically 3–10 business days depending on BI internal turnaround for record retrieval and stamping workload. Local presence and timely follow-up shorten the timeline.

### Step 1: Intake and confirm eligibility

**Estimated duration:** same day to 1 business day

Specific actions:
1. Collect client details and confirm the 9G reference (existing BI order number, I-Card number or passport visa page details).
2. Verify that the issue is a restamp (not a new visa application). Identify whether a certified true copy (CTC) from the BI records section is required.

**Required documents:** passport copy, BI reference information (if available), signed authorization if representative will act.

**Notes:** If BI cannot trace a 9G record, advise the client on next steps (for example a 9G Order Copy Request or a fuller records search) before restamping can be attempted.

### Step 2: Request CTC from BI record section

**Estimated duration:** 2–3 business days (typical internal processing; may vary)

Specific actions:
1. Submit a formal letter/request to the BI record section asking for a certified true copy (CTC) of the client's 9G visa record.
2. Provide supporting identifiers (passport number, name, BI reference, I-Card number) to assist the records search.
3. Follow up with the records section after 2–3 days to confirm availability and collection instructions.

**Completion sign:** BI records section issues a certified true copy (CTC) or provides a collection date.

**Notes:** Do not accept external or non-BI-produced copies — BI stamping unit may reject them because of counterfeit stamp risk.

### Step 3: Submit the CTC for restamping

**Estimated duration:** same day to several days (depends on stamping counter workload)

Specific actions:
1. Deliver the certified true copy and the passport to the BI stamping/endorsement unit with the required cover letter and request for restamping.
2. Pay any official BI endorsement fees if required and obtain a submission/claim stub or receipt.
3. Monitor processing and collect the passport with the restamped 9G endorsement when BI releases it.

**Completion sign:** Passport returned with an updated 9G stamp/endorsement or BI provides written confirmation of restamping.

**Potential issues:**
- Issue: Records section cannot produce a CTC or locates conflicting entries.
  - Solution: Escalate to records officers, use 9G Order Copy Request to locate original order, or coordinate with BI case officers for reconciliation.
- Issue: Stamping unit rejects the CTC because it was not issued by the records section.
  - Solution: Re-request the CTC through the formal records channel and avoid external copies.

## Price & Conditions

No fixed retail price is recorded in the source evidence for 9G Restamping. Official BI fees (if any) for certification or stamping are payable directly to BI. Agent handling fees (for records request, submission, follow-up, and courier if required) should be quoted at intake based on urgency and representation requirements.

**Price notes:**
- Some cases require only a records request and local submission (lower agent fee).
- Complex cases that require records reconciliation or additional BI coordination may incur higher handling fees.

## Important notes / Risks

### Processing limitations
- BI records and stamping units operate independently; obtaining a CTC from the record section is a prerequisite in most cases and may delay the process.
- BI will not accept copies produced outside of its record section due to counterfeit concerns — ensure the CTC is officially issued by BI.

### Time requirements
- Expect at least 2–3 business days for record section to prepare a CTC; stamping may add further days depending on workload.

### Risk warnings
- If BI cannot reconcile records or finds irregularities, restamping may be refused; such cases may require escalation or additional BI procedures to resolve the underlying record.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why do I need a CTC from the BI records section?**
A: BI requires an official certified true copy issued by its records section because original external copies or visually recreated stamps are sometimes counterfeit. The records-produced CTC is the authoritative evidence BI uses for restamping.

**Q: Can I submit an original copy I already have from another office?**
A: No. Source evidence and BI practice indicate external originals/CTCs are commonly rejected for restamping because of fake/stolen-stamp risk. Obtain the CTC directly from BI record section.

**Q: How long does the whole restamping take?**
A: Typical turnaround is 3–10 business days depending on BI record retrieval and stamping queue. Urgency and local follow-up can shorten the effective time.
