# AEP Annual Review

## Summary

The AEP Annual Review is an administrative check related to AEP/immigration records that requires the visa holder (I-Card holder) to attend the Bureau of Immigration in person for a short interview and verification. During the visit the cardholder must present their passport and I-Card. After the interview the Bureau issues a payment slip which the client or our staff will pay; an official receipt or acknowledgement is produced by the Bureau of Immigration upon payment.

This service is intended for employers, HR teams and individual beneficiaries who must complete the annual administrative review associated with their AEP/BI I-Card record to remain compliant with immigration requirements.

No fixed agent fee is recorded in the source evidence for performing the review. Official Bureau of Immigration fees (if any) apply and are payable to BI at the counter. Agent handling fees for representation or payment facilitation are charged separately and quoted at intake.

- The cardholder is expected to attend in person for the interview; representation may not be accepted in all BI counters. Confirm representation rules before sending an agent.

### Time-sensitive guidance
- Attend the BI counter early in the day to minimize queue delays. Bring originals; BI may temporarily hold documents.

### Risk warnings
- If the underlying AEP/I-Card record is invalid or if the AEP was discovered to be fraudulent, BI may refuse routine processing and additional penalties (including fines or classification actions) could apply. Advise the client to disclose accurate status and consult on remediation if issues arise.
