# 5-Year 13A Marriage I-Card Replacement

## Summary

This service assists holders of a 13A marriage visa who need to replace or renew the 5-year marriage I-Card (13A I-Card) when the printed card must be replaced, reissued or updated. Typical clients are foreign spouses of Filipino citizens whose issued 13A I-Card has reached its scheduled replacement period (five years for certain nationalities) or who need a physical card reissued due to wear, malfunction or updated records. The task covers document intake, submission to the Bureau of Immigration (BI), payment handling, monitoring, and collection of the reissued 13A I-Card.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to request this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The cardholder or an authorised local representative must be physically present in the Philippines for in-person BI steps if BI requires them (photograph/biometrics or original document submission). Some advisory and document-preparation steps can be done remotely but the final card collection often requires local attendance.
- Relationship prerequisite: The applicant must be the foreign spouse who holds or is entitled to a 13A marriage classification, or an authorised representative acting with signed authorisation accepted by BI.
- Business prerequisite: The client must hold a valid passport and provide the existing 13A I-Card (if available) or acceptable proof explaining loss. If the I-Card was permanently lost, follow the ACR/I-Card replacement and affidavit processes first.

Not eligible:
- Persons outside the Philippines who cannot participate in required BI in-person procedures where BI mandates principal presence.
- Cases where the client does not meet 13A eligibility (for example not married to a Filipino) — those require separate visa application services.

## Required documents

### Documents the client must provide (cannot be produced by this service)

1) Passport bio page (original or clear scanned copy):
- Type: original × 1 (for in-person steps) or clear scanned copy for remote intake
- Requirement: Valid passport. BI may ask for the original during submission and will return it on release.
- How used: Identity verification and to cross-check visa endorsement.

2) Existing 13A marriage visa/order or I-Card (if available):
- Type: original or copy × 1
- Requirement: Present the current I-Card or BI order / endorsement that proves 13A classification. If the I-Card is present it will usually be borrowed during processing and returned upon release.
- How used: Provided to BI as supporting evidence for replacement.

3) Marriage certificate (PSA or equivalent):
- Type: original/certified copy × 1
- Requirement: Official proof of marriage to a Filipino citizen used to verify the 13A basis.
- How used: Supporting evidence during BI submission; borrowed and returned as BI procedures require.

Notes: If any document is missing (for example the marriage certificate), the client must obtain it before the BI submission can proceed. Originals are commonly held by BI while processing.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Typically 1–2 weeks from submission to collection if all documents and payments are ready; BI workload can extend this timeline.

### Step 1: Intake & document verification

**Estimated duration:** 1–3 business days

Actions:
1. Collect passport copy, marriage certificate, and the existing I-Card (if available). Verify all documents meet BI requirements.
2. Confirm client is eligible and advise whether personal attendance at BI will be required for photo/biometrics.
3. Provide a service quote and collect the agreed fee or deposit if required.

**Needed documents:** passport, marriage certificate, existing I-Card (if available).

**Notes:** If the client lacks the marriage certificate or other mandatory evidence, the agent will advise how to obtain it and may offer auxiliary services.

### Step 2: Prepare submission packet and payment

**Estimated duration:** Same day to 2 business days

Actions:
1. Complete BI application forms for I-Card replacement, prepare the cover letter, and compile supporting evidence.
2. Collect the full replacement fee as agreed with the client (agent handling fee + BI official fees if the provider collects them on behalf of the client).

**Completion sign:** BI submission packet ready and payment confirmed.

### Step 3: Submit to Bureau of Immigration

**Estimated duration:** Submission day (processing as per BI workload)

Actions:
1. Submit the packet to the appropriate BI office in person or via authorised representative where BI accepts representation.
2. If BI requires personal attendance for biometrics or photo capture, coordinate the appointment with the client.
3. Obtain BI submission receipt and record reference numbers.

**Completion sign:** Submission receipt / claim stub obtained.

### Step 4: Monitor and collect new I-Card

**Estimated duration:** 1–2 weeks typical, variable with BI queues

Actions:
1. Monitor BI case progress and respond to any BI requests for clarifications or additional documents.
2. Once BI issues the new 13A I-Card, collect it and verify the printed information before delivering to the client.
3. Return any originals BI releases and provide final case closure note.

**Completion sign:** Client receives the new 13A I-Card and official receipts.

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Processing limits
- Advance timing: BI commonly requests replacement submissions to be filed well ahead of travel; the agent advises clients to submit at least one month in advance of planned travel or expiry.
- Personal attendance: Many BI steps require the cardholder to attend in person (photo/biometrics). The agent will confirm whether representation is accepted for any required stage.

### Time requirements
- Submit replacement request about one month before the intended travel or before the card becomes unusable.
- Typical processing time is 1–2 weeks but can be longer depending on BI workload.

### Risk & compliance
- If a replacement is not completed and the card expires or becomes invalid, the client may face travel disruption or additional remedial steps.
- Hold originals safe: BI may hold original documents during processing and return them on release.
