# 9A Visa Extension

## Summary

9A Visa Extension is a Bureau of Immigration service to extend a 9A tourist/temporary visitor visa for foreign nationals who are physically present in the Philippines. The service assists clients to request extensions for several standard durations (common options: 1 month, 2 months, 6 months) and in some cases longer aggregated periods reported in evidence (for example 9 months + 1 month). Express or rush handling options are available for urgent cases. Typical clients are tourists or visitors whose current stay will expire soon and who wish to remain legally in the Philippines.

---

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to request a 9A Visa Extension:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal (visa holder) or an authorized local representative must be physically present in the Philippines when original documents are required by the Bureau of Immigration.
- Relationship prerequisite: None specific beyond being the visa holder or an authorized representative acting on the visa holder's behalf.
- Business prerequisite: The client must have a valid passport and current visa/arrival stamp indicating the existing 9A status.

Not eligible:
- Persons outside the Philippines who cannot provide an authorized local representative when BI mandates in-person presence.
- Cases requiring a change of visa classification (e.g., converting to 13A, 9G, or other non-tourist categories) — those require separate application workflows.

---

## Required documents (must be provided by client)

### Passport

- Type: original × 1
- Requirement: Valid national passport with remaining validity and sufficient free pages for immigration stamping.
- How used: Presented and typically borrowed by the Bureau of Immigration during processing; passport is returned after immigration releases the documents.

Notes: The passport is the core required document that cannot be produced by our office and must be supplied by the client.

  - document: completed BI extension application forms, cover letter, and checklist
  - producer: 9A Visa Extension

## Documents obtained after completion

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Variable depending on Bureau of Immigration workload and whether express processing is used (same day to several weeks). Typical routine: same-day to a few days; express/rush options shorten processing.

### Step 1: Confirm extension duration & eligibility

**Estimated duration:** Same day (initial intake)

Specific actions:
1. Confirm the client's current visa expiry date and determine the extension duration requested (common options: 1 month, 2 months, 6 months; evidence also records 9-month and additional 1-month scenarios).
2. Verify passport validity and check for sufficient blank passport pages for stamping.
3. Advise client on fees and whether express/rush handling is required.

**Needed documents:** Passport (original)

**Notes:** Extensions must be filed before the current visa expires. Late filings can trigger fines or other BI actions.

---

### Step 2: Prepare application packet and collect passport

**Estimated duration:** Same day to 1 business day

Specific actions:
1. Prepare the Bureau of Immigration extension application forms, cover letter, and the supporting submission packet.
2. Collect the passport from the client (or receive authorization and original if BI permits representative submission).
3. Confirm payment method and collect the required fees (agent handling fee + official BI fees as applicable).

**Needed documents:** Passport (original)

**Notes:** Immigration commonly holds originals during processing; agent will record chain-of-custody and expected return time.

---

### Step 3: Lodge application with BI & monitor processing

**Estimated duration:** Dependent on BI queue; express options may reduce waiting time.

Specific actions:
1. Submit the prepared packet to the appropriate BI office and pay official fees.
2. Monitor case status and respond promptly to any BI requests for additional documents or clarifications.
3. If express/rush service was requested, follow the expedited submission procedures as available.

**Completion sign:** BI issues an acknowledgement/receipt and later returns the passport with an extension stamp or provides an official extension confirmation.

---

### Step 4: Collect passport and deliver to client

**Estimated duration:** Same day to several days after BI release

Specific actions:
1. Retrieve passport and verify the extension endorsement or the official confirmation document.
2. Deliver the passport and supporting documents back to the client and close the case.

**Notes:** Confirm with client that extension details are correct (duration, new expiry date) before case closure.

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Processing limitations
- Applicant or authorized representative generally must be physically present in the Philippines when BI requires originals.
- Extensions for visa categories other than 9A, or requests that effectively change visa classification, are outside the scope of this service and require separate procedures.

### Time requirements
- File the extension before the current visa expires to avoid overstay penalties and additional BI requirements.
- Allow extra time during peak seasons or when BI backlog is high.

### Risk warnings
- Failure to submit before expiry can result in fines, administrative orders, or other remedial processes.
- BI may retain original passport for a period; clients should plan travel accordingly.

### Special cases
- Express/rush options may be available for additional fees; evidence records special express fees for certain durations and special handling (for example express 6-month without I-Card).
- Some complex cases (overstay, missing ACR records, or identity conflicts) may require additional filings (for example ECC or related BI processes) before extensions can be granted.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Do I need to be in the Philippines to request a 9A extension?
A: Yes. The Bureau of Immigration usually requires physical presence for submission or for the return/collection of original passport. An authorized local representative may act when BI accepts representation, but not all steps can be delegated.

Q: What documents do I need to provide?
A: The primary required document is your original passport (the passport will be borrowed by BI during processing and returned upon release). Provide any prior extension receipts or visas if available.

Q: Can I request an express or rush extension?
A: Yes — express/rush options are available for certain durations at additional cost according to the provider's schedule and BI availability. Confirm the express fee and process at intake.
