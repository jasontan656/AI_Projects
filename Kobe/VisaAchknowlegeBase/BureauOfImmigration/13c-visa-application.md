# 13C Visa Application

## Summary

The 13C Visa Application assists dependents (typically children) of Permanent Resident Visa (PRV) holders to have their immigration record attached or endorsed under the petitioner's PRV. The service focuses on preparing and submitting the BI packet, photocopying required supporting documents, producing a formal request letter, and coordinating with the petitioner to obtain the PRV stamp or endorsement required by Bureau of Immigration (BI). Typical clients are dependents of PRV holders who need a dependent endorsement or visa attachment to regularize immigration records for travel or residency.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to request this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal (dependent) or an authorized representative should be in the Philippines when BI requires physical attendance for submission, biometrics, or final collection. Some preparatory work can be done remotely, but BI often requires originals to be submitted in person or by an accepted representative.
- Relationship prerequisite: The applicant must be a dependent of a petitioner who already holds a PRV (Permanent Resident Visa) or an equivalent immigration endorsement recognized by BI. Proof of relationship (birth certificate, PSA) and evidence of the petitioner's PRV status are core requirements.
- Business prerequisite: The petitioner must be able to supply the PRV stamp/original endorsement (or an official copy acceptable to BI) and must cooperate in providing signatures or request letters if required by BI.

Not eligible:
- Cases where the petitioner does not hold a valid PRV endorsement.
- Cases where required civil documents (for example PSA birth certificate) cannot be produced or legalized as required by BI.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Varies by BI workload; typical BI processing ranges from several weeks to a few months. Agent-side document preparation and submission usually takes 1–5 business days depending on client readiness.

### Step 1: Intake and document verification

**Estimated time:** 0.5–2 business days

Specific actions:
1. Collect scanned copies and schedule collection of originals when BI requires them.
2. Confirm petitioner PRV endorsement availability and request petitioner to provide the PRV stamp/original or a certified copy for submission.
3. Verify PSA birth certificate and passport pages for BI acceptance.

**Documents needed:** petitioner passport copy, petitioner PRV stamp (original or certified copy), dependent PSA birth certificate, dependent passport (if available).

**Notes:** If PSA or other civil documents are missing, advise client on steps to obtain them before proceeding.

### Step 2: Prepare submission packet

**Estimated time:** 1–3 business days

Specific actions:
1. Draft and print the formal request letter for the petitioner to sign.
2. Photocopy required original documents and compile the BI submission packet according to BI checklist.
3. Prepare any agent authorization or representation letters if the petitioner or dependent will not attend in person and BI accepts representation.

**Completion sign:** Submission packet is complete and petitioner has signed required letters or authorizations.

### Step 3: Submit to Bureau of Immigration and follow-up

**Estimated time:** Variable (BI processing may take weeks)

Specific actions:
1. Submit the packet to the appropriate BI office in person or via authorized representative where permitted.
2. Pay official BI fees and obtain submission receipt.
3. Monitor BI progress and respond quickly to any BI requests for additional evidence.

**Completion sign:** BI issues the dependent endorsement or returns originals with the endorsement recorded.

## Price & Fees

No fixed agent fees or official BI fees are recorded in the source evidence for 13C processing. Official BI fees apply at time of filing and agent service charges (if any) should be quoted at intake based on case complexity and whether representation is required.

**Price notes:**
- Agent service fee (if charged) normally covers form preparation, drafting the request letter, photocopying, submission and case follow-up. BI fees (processing, endorsement charges) are payable separately to BI.

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Processing limitations
- The petitioner must hold a valid PRV endorsement; without this the dependent attachment cannot proceed.
- BI may require original documents for submission and may hold originals temporarily during processing; clients should be prepared to surrender originals and receive them back on release.

### Timing requirements
- Start the process early if travel is planned; BI processing times vary and may delay travel plans.

### Risks
- Missing or non-legible civil documents (for example PSA birth certificate) will delay or block the attachment. Ensure PSA documents meet BI acceptance standards.
- If the petitioner's PRV status is under review or not properly endorsed, the dependent attachment may be refused.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Do I need to be in the Philippines to apply for a 13C dependent endorsement?
A: Some preparatory work can be done remotely, but BI often requires originals or an in-person submission. If the principal cannot attend, confirm with BI whether an authorized representative may submit on their behalf.

Q: What is a PRV stamp and why is it required?
A: The PRV stamp is the petitioner's permanent residency endorsement or stamp in their passport/Bureau of Immigration record. BI requires evidence of the petitioner's immigration basis to attach a dependent under that basis.

Q: How long does the BI take to process a dependent attachment under PRV?
A: BI processing times vary. Expect several weeks in normal circumstances; complex cases or requests for additional documents may extend timelines.
