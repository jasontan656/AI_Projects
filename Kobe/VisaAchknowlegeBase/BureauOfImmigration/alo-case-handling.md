# ALO Case Handling

## Summary

ALO Case Handling is a short, practical service that helps a client manage immediate Alien Landing Order (ALO) related operational tasks: retrieving a passport held by the Bureau of Immigration, advising on urgent travel options before visa expiry, and providing basic exit guidance to avoid costly penalties or enforcement consequences. Typical users are foreign nationals who discover an ALO flag or whose passport is temporarily held by immigration during related processing. The service supports secure passport retrieval through an authorised representative, fast advisory on whether to depart before visa expiry, and escalation to remedial services such as ALO Lifting or Airport Exit Clearance when necessary. It is intended for clients who require quick operational support rather than long legal appeals.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to use ALO Case Handling:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal or an authorised local representative must be in the Philippines or able to provide a local authorised representative. The passport retrieval step typically requires local attendance or signed authorisation accepted by the Bureau of Immigration (BI).
- Relationship prerequisite: The requester must be the passport holder (principal) or an authorised representative (for example an agent appointed by the principal). Proof of authorisation must be provided when representation is used.
- Business prerequisite: The client must provide accurate identity details (passport bio page, full legal name and passport number) and confirm whether they hold a long-term immigration visa or another category. ALO-related operational handling is normally relevant only when the client has a long-term or immigrant-type record recorded with BI.

Not eligible:
- Clients outside the Philippines who cannot provide a local authorised representative when BI requires in-person verification.
- Cases that require formal legal appeals or litigation only; ALO Lifting (administrative removal) and legal counsel are separate services when legal arguments or court-level intervention is needed.

## Required documents

### Documents the client must provide (must be provided by client)

**Passport (bio page scan and original when requested):**
- Type: original × 1 when agent or BI requires physical presentation. A clear scanned copy is required at intake.
- Requirements: Full passport bio page (name exactly as printed, passport number, nationality, expiry date).
- How used: Identity verification during the BI query and to collect the physical passport from BI. When a representative acts, the client must provide a signed authorisation and an ID for the agent.

**Authorisation to act (if agent collects passport):**
- Type: original or scanned signed letter × 1
- Requirements: A signed authorisation naming the authorised representative, brief scope (retrieve passport), date and client signature.
- How used: Presented to BI to permit the agent to collect the passport on the client’s behalf where BI accepts representation.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Variable; most operational steps (status check, agent pickup request and in-person collection) can be completed in 1–7 business days depending on BI workload and logistics.

### Step 1 — Intake & Status Check

**Estimated duration:** same day (hours)

**Actions:**
1. Client provides a clear scanned copy of the passport bio page and confirms the current visa expiry date and any prior BI correspondence.
2. Agent performs an ALO List Inquiry or 9G Visa Status Check (if relevant) to confirm whether an ALO or any enforcement flag exists and whether the passport is being held by BI.
3. Agent advises client about high-level options: retrieve passport and depart before expiry, attempt ALO Lifting, or arrange airport exit channel if ALO prevents normal departure.

**Documents needed:** passport scan, authorisation if agent will act.

**Notes:** If an ALO is detected, the agent highlights immediate risks (fines, OTL, inability to return for a set period) and proposes remedial services.

### Step 2 — Authorisation & Agent Representation

**Estimated duration:** 0.5–1 day

**Actions:**
1. Client signs a simple authorisation letter permitting the named agent to collect the passport on their behalf. Provide ID copies as required.
2. Agent prepares a passport retrieval packet to present at the BI counter (authorisation, ID copies, client contact details).

**Needed documents:** signed authorisation, client ID copy.

**Notes:** BI acceptance of representation varies. If BI insists on principal presence, agent will inform the client immediately.

### Step 3 — Passport Retrieval at BI

**Estimated duration:** 1–3 business days depending on BI queue and document release timeline

**Actions:**
1. Agent visits the Bureau of Immigration with the authorised documents, verifies identity per BI processes, and requests passport release. Agent obtains a signed BI release stub or receipt.
2. Agent logs chain-of-custody, photographs the handover receipt (where allowed), and returns the passport to the client with an agent-issued receipt.

**Completion sign:** Client possesses the passport and agent issues a retrieval confirmation.

**Possible issues:**
- BI may withhold passport pending unresolved administrative steps; agent will report and propose alternatives (de-escalation, formal request, ALO Lifting).

### Step 4 — Immediate Travel Advice & Next Steps

**Estimated duration:** same day

**Actions:**
1. If the passport is retrieved and the visa is unexpired, agent strongly recommends the client depart before the visa expiry to avoid overstay penalties or OTL.
2. If the passport is released but there is evidence of an impending ALO or BI warning, agent outlines options: immediate departure, seek ALO Lifting (administrative removal), or, where available, arrange ALO Airport Exit Clearance (operational channel) if the client cannot leave by normal means.
3. Provide the client with an advisory note including timelines, likely fees, and contact information for the related remedial services.

**Notes:** Practical guidance includes recommending leaving before the listed expiry date and avoiding overstays; if client cannot depart, the agent advises to start remedial administrative or legal processes immediately.

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Processing limitations
- BI may require the principal to be physically present for some releases. Representation is permitted only when BI accepts the authorisation.
- ALO Case Handling is an operational assistance service — it does not itself remove ALO records. For record removal, see the ALO Lifting service.

### Timing requirements
- Depart before visa expiry whenever possible — evidence shows leaving before expiry avoids expensive fines and OTL outcomes.
- If the visa has already expired, immediate remedial steps (OTL arrangements, ALO Airport Exit Clearance or legal counsel) are recommended.

### Risk warnings
- Overstaying a visa can trigger fines, an Order to Leave (OTL), and re-entry restrictions (often one year inability to return). If the visa is near expiry, do not delay.
- Operational channels like ALO Airport Exit Clearance are expensive and not guaranteed; administrative ALO Lifting is a separate process and can take longer.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: My passport is with the Bureau of Immigration — can you get it back for me?**
A: In many routine cases we can retrieve the passport via an authorised representative. BI sometimes holds passports for internal processing; success depends on BI's current instructions and whether originals or the principal's attendance is required.

**Q: What if my visa is expiring very soon?**
A: If your visa is still valid, the fastest and safest option is to leave the Philippines before the expiry date. If you cannot leave in time or your visa already expired, we advise immediate remedial steps and may propose ALO Lifting or airport exit options.

**Q: Does this service remove the ALO from my record?**
A: No. ALO Case Handling helps with immediate operational tasks (passport retrieval, exit advice). Permanent removal of an ALO is performed using the ALO Lifting service which is a separate administrative/legal process.
