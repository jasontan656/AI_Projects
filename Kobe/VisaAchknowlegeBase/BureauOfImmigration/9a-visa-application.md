# 9A Visa Application Assistance

## Summary

9A Visa Application Assistance is a short, focused service that helps a visitor complete the Bureau of Immigration 9A tourist visa application form and related submission checklists. Typical clients are foreign nationals currently in the Philippines who need help filling the standard 9A application page(s) because they lack access to a computer, need translation or formatting help, or prefer an agent to prepare a legible, submission-ready application. The service does not file the application with the Bureau of Immigration by default, unless the client requests submission support or authorizes an in-person representative to deliver the completed forms. The primary deliverable is a fully completed 9A application form and a short submission checklist the client can use to file or hand to an authorized representative.

- Relationship prerequisite: None specific. The client must be the applicant or an authorized representative with written permission to sign or submit on the applicant's behalf.
- Business prerequisite: The client must have a passport (or a clear copy) and the basic travel information needed to complete the 9A application (dates of arrival, intended duration of stay, accommodation details, return ticket information etc.).

## Service process

Total estimated duration: 0.5–2 business days for form completion depending on client responsiveness and document availability. If in-person submission is requested, additional time may be required for filing and BI processing.

### Step 1: Intake and information capture

Estimated time: 0.25–1 business day

Specific actions:
1. Client shares passport copy and travel details via secure channel (email, encrypted message or in-person).
2. Agent confirms the exact 9A form variant and clarifies any ambiguous fields (e.g., occupation, purpose of visit).
3. Agent provides a short intake checklist and a quote for the form-filling service and any optional submission assistance.

Required items:
- Passport copy, travel dates, accommodation details, contact info.

Notes:
- If the client is missing critical data, the agent will list the missing items and pause until they are provided.

### Step 2: Drafting and form completion

Estimated time: 0.5–1 business day

Specific actions:
1. Agent completes the 9A form using client-provided data, ensuring legibility and correctness.
2. Agent prepares the 9A Submission Checklist listing supporting documents the BI will expect at filing time.
3. Agent returns the completed draft to the client for review and signature instructions.

Completion sign:
- Client confirms all details are accurate and approves the completed form for signing.

### Step 3: Review, signature and submission guidance (optional)

Estimated time: same day to 1 business day

Specific actions:
1. If the client is local and requests filing assistance, the agent arranges an in-person submission or sends the completed package to an authorized representative with the signed authorization template.
2. If the client will file themselves, the agent provides step-by-step filing instructions, required fees, and expected BI counter location and opening hours.
3. Agent can optionally accompany the client to BI or submit the packet on the client's behalf when properly authorized.

Completion sign:
- The client obtains a BI submission receipt or confirmation when the form is filed.

Possible issues and mitigations:
- Problem: Client provides inconsistent passport data.
  - Solution: Agent requests a clear passport photo or scanned page before finalizing the form.
- Problem: BI requires physical presence for signature or other verification.
  - Solution: Agent prepares an authorization letter and advises the client on whether a representative is accepted for this step.

## Price & Fees

No fixed official fee is recorded for simple form-filling. Typical fee structure examples (agent handling only):

- Form completion only: modest fixed fee (quote provided at intake)
- Form completion + submission guidance: additional fee depending on complexity
- In-person filing by authorized representative: extra service fee plus courier or travel costs

Price notes:
- Official Bureau of Immigration fees are payable directly to BI at time of submission and are not included in the agent's handling fee unless explicitly stated.

---

## Important notes and risk warnings

- Provide accurate passport details. Mistyped passport numbers or names that do not match the passport will cause BI to reject the application.
- If the client plans travel during the form processing period, ensure signatures and originals are coordinated to avoid missed flights.
- Authorization for a representative to file on the client's behalf must be explicit and may be rejected by BI for some verification steps.
- Agent does not guarantee BI approval; this service prepares the paperwork for filing only.

A: A clear copy/photo of your passport bio page, travel dates, local contact or hotel details, and a recent passport photo if required by the BI form.
