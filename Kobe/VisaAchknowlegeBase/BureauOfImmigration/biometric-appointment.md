# Biometric Appointment

## Summary

A Biometric Appointment is the process of scheduling and attending an official session to capture biometric identifiers (fingerprints and/or face photograph) required by immigration and government agencies for identity verification. Typical users include visa applicants, card replacement applicants (I-Card, AEP/PRV/13A clients), and anyone who must provide live biometrics to the Bureau of Immigration (BI) as part of a filing. The service helps schedule the slot, prepare the client, attend or coordinate attendance, record completion, and deliver the appointment confirmation as an output for downstream filings.

The biometric appointment is usually a short, mandatory step in many immigration processes — for example 9G and 13A filings, I-Card replacement, and some PRV and AEP processes — and must be completed at BI or an authorised biometric capture center.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions before the biometric appointment can be scheduled or completed:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal (applicant) usually must be physically present in the Philippines to attend an in-person biometric capture, unless the agency explicitly allows authorised representation. Remote scheduling is possible but the capture step is normally in-person.

- Relationship prerequisite: The person who attends must be the actual applicant (the principal) whose fingerprints/photo will be recorded. In limited circumstances BI may accept authorised representation for scheduling but not for the actual biometric capture itself.

- Business prerequisite: The biometric appointment is normally required only where an immigration filing or card issuance mandates live biometrics. Typical upstream necessities include a submitted BI application packet, a paid fee or deposit, and at least a provisional receipt or booking reference that the biometric unit requires to confirm identity and link the records.

Not eligible:
- Applicants outside the Philippines who cannot attend in-person and where no permitted representation or alternate capture channel exists.
- Cases where the agency explicitly waives biometrics; the appointment is not required in such cases.

## Required documents and information

### Documents the client must provide (cannot be produced by this business)

These items must be supplied by the client prior to or on the day of the biometric appointment:

- Passport (original)
  - Type: original × 1
  - Requirement: Valid passport bio page presented for identity verification. The passport is used to confirm identity at the biometric counter and will be shown to capture staff. The passport is usually returned immediately; in some workflows it may be temporarily held by the agency during processing.

- Appointment confirmation / booking reference
  - Type: electronic confirmation or printout × 1
  - Requirement: The appointment slot reference or booking confirmation provided when the appointment was scheduled. Agencies commonly require this barcode or reference on arrival.

- Supporting application receipt (if applicable)
  - Type: copy or original × 1
  - Requirement: Proof of a prior application or payment (for example BI application receipt or agent submission stub) when the biometric session is part of an application chain.

Notes: Always confirm the specific documentation requested in the appointment confirmation email or booking page (some centers require a printed barcode).

### Documents and outputs this business can produce

- Appointment booking confirmation (digital)
  - document: "Biometric Appointment Confirmation"
  - producer: "Biometric Appointment"
  - path: "BureauOfImmigration/biometric-appointment.md"
  - usage: A PDF or screenshot proving the appointment was scheduled and linking the candidate name and booking reference to the downstream immigration case.

- Attendance record (producer/agent note)
  - document: "Biometric Attendance Record"
  - producer: "Biometric Appointment"
  - path: "BureauOfImmigration/biometric-appointment.md"
  - usage: Internal case evidence confirming the client attended and the capture was completed (timestamp, location, officer counter number).

---

## What the client receives after completion

- Appointment confirmation / attendance note (digital and optional printed copy)
  - Type: confirmation of attendance and biometrics capture × 1
  - Use: This confirmation is used as proof of completing the biometric step and is attached to downstream immigration filings (visa application files, I-Card replacement packages, etc.).
  - Retention: Keep a digital copy for the client case file and provide one to the client for their records.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Booking typically takes minutes; waiting for an available slot and attending the biometric session typically requires 1–14 days depending on BI appointment availability and workload. The captured session itself usually takes 5–20 minutes.

### Step 1: Intake and eligibility check

**Estimated duration:** 10–30 minutes

**Actions:**
1. Confirm client identity and which immigration filing requires the biometric capture (visa type, I-Card replacement, PRV issuance, etc.).
2. Verify client has a valid passport and any required application receipt or booking reference.
3. Confirm if the client has restrictions (mobility, language) that require special accommodations.

**Required documents:** passport copy, application receipt (if any)

**Notes:** If the client is a minor or has special needs, schedule a slot that permits a guardian or assistance.

---

### Step 2: Book the biometric appointment

**Estimated duration:** same day to a few days depending on slot availability

**Actions:**
1. Access the BI or authorised biometric center booking portal and search for available slots linked to the relevant application reference.
2. Reserve the earliest convenient slot, confirm the booking details, and generate the appointment confirmation (barcode/reference).
3. Send the confirmation to the client, including arrival instructions, required documents to bring and recommended arrival time.

**Completion sign:** The client receives a booking confirmation including date/time and reference code.

---

### Step 3: Attend the biometric appointment and capture

**Estimated duration:** appointment duration 5–20 minutes; allow 30–90 minutes for travel and queue

**Actions:**
1. Client presents the passport, booking confirmation and application receipt at the biometric center check-in.
2. Staff verify identity, scan the booking barcode and proceed with biometric capture (fingerprint scan and photograph as required).
3. Client signs any acknowledgement forms required by the biometric center.
4. If the capture completes successfully, obtain an attendance acknowledgement and any transaction number to attach to the case file.

**Completion sign:** The biometric unit confirms the capture was successful and issues an attendance note or confirmation.

**Possible issues and solutions:**
- Problem: Fingerprint capture fails due to dry/worn prints or technical issue
  - Solution: Use biometric lubricant or alternative capture slot, reschedule if hardware problem; escalate to technical staff for troubleshooting.
- Problem: Booking mismatch or missing receipt
  - Solution: Present ID and application reference; agent can liaise with the center to locate the booking or rebook the slot where permitted.

### Step 4: Deliver confirmation and link to downstream filing

**Estimated duration:** same day

**Actions:**
1. Attach the biometric attendance confirmation to the client case record and forward it to the team handling the related immigration filing (for example the 9G application or I-Card replacement packet).
2. Advise the client on any subsequent steps that depend on the biometric completion (for example submission windows, follow-up BI processing times).

**Completion sign:** Downstream filing receives biometric confirmation and continues processing.

## Price & Fees

No standard government fee is charged specifically by this service for scheduling the appointment. Official BI or biometric center fees (if any) apply at the time of submission or at the center. Agents may charge a facilitation fee when they book or coordinate an appointment on behalf of the client; confirm the facilitation fee at intake.

Price notes:
- Many immigration filings collect official fees separately at submission; biometric booking alone is usually free or included in the overall application fee.
- Agent facilitation fee (example): charged case-by-case and quoted at intake.

---

## Important notes / Restrictions

### Attendance and identity
- The biometric capture process is strictly identity-linked; the person who attends must be the same person named on the application and on the booking. Mismatches will cause rejection or rescheduling.

### Timing requirements
- Complete the biometric appointment within the application timeline (some filings may have validity windows after biometric capture). If you delay too long, rebooking or application refresh may be required.

### Risks & caveats
- Technical failures at the biometric center do happen; allow wiggle room in travel and schedule to repeat the capture if necessary.
- Incorrect booking details, name spelling errors, or mismatched passport numbers will delay downstream processing. Verify all entries when booking.

## Common Questions

Q: Can someone attend my biometric appointment on my behalf?  
A: No. Biometric capture requires the principal's personal presence. Some centers accept an agent for scheduling only, but the capture itself demands the applicant.

Q: How long does a biometric session take?  
A: The capture itself typically takes 5–20 minutes; overall appointment time including check-in and queue may take 30–90 minutes.

Q: Will the appointment confirm my visa issuance?  
A: No. The biometric appointment only captures identity biometrics. It does not guarantee visa approval or I-Card printing — it is a required step for many filings but final adjudication remains with the agency.
