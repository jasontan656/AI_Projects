# Category 2 Downgrade to Tourist Visa

## Summary

Category 2 Downgrade to Tourist Visa is an immigration procedure used by foreign nationals in the Philippines whose work visa (or other employment-based permit) is about to expire and who wish to remain in the country by converting their status into a tourist entry instead of immediately departing. After a successful downgrade, the client is effectively treated as entering on a tourist basis and may be able to extend that tourist status for up to two years through legal extension steps or apply to other visa categories. This service is targeted at individuals who need to regularize their stay without immediate departure and who accept the operational risks of the procedure.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions before we can process a Category 2 downgrade:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal (or an authorized representative where BI allows) must be physically present in the Philippines for any steps that require in-person submission, biometrics, or face-to-face processing. Some advisory work may be done remotely but the critical steps typically require local presence.
- Relationship prerequisite: None specific other than being the visa holder wishing to change their status (for example those holding an expiring work visa, employer-sponsored visa, or other temporary authorization).
- Business prerequisite: The client must hold a valid passport and provide current immigration documentation (work visa page, arrival stamp). If the operation requires cancellation or formal closure of the prior employment visa, relevant documents or employer cooperation may be needed.

Not eligible:
- Persons who are outside the Philippines and cannot lawfully re-enter under the proposed tourist arrangement.
- Cases where the client's immigration history or prior violations make the downgrade impossible or likely to trigger enforcement actions (for example active deportation/OTL orders or complex enforcement flags requiring legal counsel).

---

## Required documents (must be provided by client)

The following documents must be provided by the client and cannot be produced by this service:

- Passport (original): 1 original passport presented for verification. The passport may be temporarily held by immigration during processing and will be returned upon release.
  - Requirements: Valid passport with sufficient remaining pages and validity as requested by immigration.
  - Use: Identity verification and submission to BI.

- Current visa / entry stamp (original): Proof of the existing work visa/permit or current entry status.
  - Requirements: Clear passport pages showing the visa/entry stamp that is expiring or being changed.
  - Use: To evaluate eligibility and to prepare the downgrade application.

Notes: Depending on the client's case, additional documents (for example employer cancellation letter or evidence of termination) may be required by immigration to process a status change. The agent will request these if BI asks.

## Outcome / Documents obtained after completion

Upon completion, the client may receive:

- Tourist-entry endorsement or stamped confirmation (if BI issues a tourist endorsement in lieu of the prior work visa) — type: official record / passport endorsement.
- Administrative receipt and case notes produced by the service showing the steps taken on behalf of the client.

Validity and downstream use:
- The downgraded tourist status may allow legal stay and may be extended subject to immigration rules; the client may later apply to other visa categories using the tourist status where allowed by law.

Retention: Keep all BI receipts and immigration endorsements securely; these documents are required for subsequent extensions, visa transfers, or travel.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Varies by Bureau of Immigration workload and case complexity. Typical timeline: from same day advisory to several weeks for formal processing and release depending on BI queues.

### Step 1: Case intake and eligibility assessment

**Estimated duration:** Same day to 1 business day

Specific actions:
1. Collect passport and current visa/entry evidence from the client (scans initially; originals for submission if required).
2. Review the immigration record and recent travel history to identify any red flags (overstays, prior enforcement orders, or other issues).
3. Advise the client on the feasibility and operational risks (including possibility of receiving an Order to Leave (OTL) if BI finds procedural irregularities).

**Documents needed:** passport copy, current visa/entry evidence.

**Notes:** If the client's background reveals enforcement risks, we will escalate the case to immigration counsel or advise alternative lawful pathways.


### Step 2: Prepare application and supporting packet

**Estimated duration:** 1–3 business days

Specific actions:
1. Draft the submission packet and supporting cover letter to Bureau of Immigration explaining the requested change of status and attaching required documents.
2. Confirm whether any employer letters or cancellations are required and obtain them if necessary.
3. Prepare the client for any in-person attendance, fees, or biometric requirements.

**Documents needed:** passport original (if BI requires), visa pages, any employer statements.

**Completion sign:** Submission packet ready and client authorizes submission.


### Step 3: Submit to Bureau of Immigration and follow up

**Estimated duration:** Variable (days to weeks)

Specific actions:
1. File the downgrade request with BI and pay any official fees.
2. Monitor BI processing and respond to any requests for further evidence or clarifications.
3. Collect the passport and official endorsement or receipt upon BI release and deliver them to the client.

**Completion sign:** BI issues the tourist endorsement or provides official confirmation that the client's status has been changed.

**Possible issues:**
- Problem: BI determines case raises enforcement concerns and issues an Order to Leave (OTL) or requests immediate departure.
  - Mitigation: Provide immediate advisory on next steps, consider emergency legal counsel, and prepare documentation for appeal or clarification where appropriate.

| 2024-05 | PHP | 32000 | Service fee quoted for Category 2 downgrade handling | Typical agent handling fee for processing the downgrade request (official BI fees not included) | message 530121 |

Price notes:

## Important notes and risks

### Processing limitations
- BI retains discretion: Bureau of Immigration may accept, deny, or convert the request and may require the client to depart. We cannot guarantee BI approval.

### Time-related considerations
- Processing times vary with BI queue and case complexity. Start the process early if the client needs to avoid inadvertent unlawful overstay.

### Risk warnings
- If the procedure is handled incorrectly or if BI identifies irregularities in the client record, the client may be issued an Order to Leave (OTL) or other enforcement action. This is a serious outcome and the primary operational risk of this service.
- Agents should verify client history carefully to avoid triggering enforcement measures.

### Recommendations
- Use a reliable and experienced agent for this procedure.
- Fully disclose prior overstays or enforcement contact to the agent during intake so appropriate risk assessment and mitigations can be planned.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What is a Category 2 downgrade?**
A: Informally called "Category 2 downgrade" in the source chat evidence, it refers to changing a current employment/work visa status into a tourist-type status so the person can remain in the Philippines under tourist allowances rather than under the expiring work visa.

**Q: How long can I stay after the downgrade?**
A: According to extracted evidence, the process can enable extensions up to a maximum period equivalent to about two years by using tourist-type extensions or subsequent filings where allowed; exact duration depends on BI rules and extension steps executed after the downgrade.

**Q: Will I be forced to leave if I apply?**
A: There is a risk. If immigration identifies violations or procedural problems, BI may issue an Order to Leave (OTL). Proper risk assessment and careful handling are essential.

**Q: Are official BI fees included in the quoted price?**
A: No. The agent handling fee (e.g., PHP 32,000 noted in chat evidence) excludes official BI fees, penalties, and courier/biometric costs.
