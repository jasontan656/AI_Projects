# BLO Lifting Order Implementation

## Summary

The BLO Lifting Order Implementation service handles the submission and execution steps required to implement a Bureau Lifting Order (BLO) or similar administrative removal order with immigration. The work focuses on filing the lifting order with the Bureau of Immigration, ensuring required payments are made (for example express lane or processing fees), and coordinating with the client and immigration officers to complete the administrative implementation. Typical users are clients who already have an issued lifting order document and need operational support to finalize the implementation at immigration counters.

---

## Background prerequisites

Clients must meet these basic conditions before this service can proceed:

- Geographic prerequisite: The client or an authorised local representative must be physically available in the Philippines if the Bureau of Immigration requires in-person attendance to implement the order or to accept payments.
- Relationship prerequisite: The requester must be the person named in the lifting order or an authorised representative with a signed authorisation letter accepted by BI.
- Business prerequisite: The client must have the original BLO (the lifting order) ready. If additional upstream remediation (for example legal appeals) is needed, this operational implementation service is not sufficient; legal counsel or the ALO Lifting administrative service should be engaged.

Not eligible:
- Cases requiring legal appeals or contested litigation beyond administrative implementation.

## Required documents

### Documents the client must provide (cannot be produced by this service)

**BLO Lifting Order**
- Type: original × 1
- Required: Yes
- Notes: The original lifting order must be presented during processing. The lifting order will be used at the immigration counter and must be the official original document.

**Client identification**
- Type: passport original or valid government ID
- Required: Yes
- Notes: The client (or authorised representative) must present ID for verification at the BI counter.

### Documents the service can help produce or provide

- Payment proof package: if the agent pays fees on behalf of the client, we will produce a consolidated payment confirmation and attached receipts for the client file.

---

## Outcome / Deliverables

After completion the client will receive:

- Official implementation receipt or acknowledgement from the Bureau of Immigration confirming that the lifting order implementation step was filed and processed.
- Payment receipts for fees paid on behalf of the client (if applicable).
- A short case note summarising actions performed, the BI reference or receipt numbers, and any outstanding follow-up actions.

---

## Process / Steps

Total estimated duration: same day to a few business days depending on BI queue and payment clearing.

### Step 1 — Intake and document check

**Estimated time:** same day

1. Confirm the client has the original BLO lifting order and valid ID.
2. Verify any special instructions or additional documents that BI may require for implementation (for example power of attorney if an authorised representative will act).
3. Obtain client authorisation for payment if the agent is to pay BI processing or express lane fees.

**Required documents:** BLO lifting order (original), client ID, payment authorisation (if applicable).

### Step 2 — Payment and filing at BI

**Estimated time:** same day

1. Attend the Bureau of Immigration counter with the original order and client ID.
2. Submit the lifting order implementation request and pay the required processing fees. If the client authorised the agent to pay the fee, agent will provide the official payment receipt.
3. Obtain the BI submission receipt or acknowledgement and record the BI reference.

**Notes:** In some cases an express lane or rush processing fee may be required or available; the client should confirm the service level desired during intake.

### Step 3 — Coordination and confirmation

**Estimated time:** same day to 48 hours (depending on BI processing)

1. Monitor BI progress and follow up as needed to confirm the order has been implemented.
2. Deliver the BI acknowledgement and payment receipts to the client.
3. Advise the client on any further steps or documentation now available as a result of the implementation (for example release of held passport or formal system status change).

## Price & Fees

| Effective Date | Currency | Amount | Applicable Conditions | Notes | Evidence |
|---------------:|:--------:|-------:|---------------------:|------:|---------:|
| 2023-12 | PHP | 35000 | Implementation and express lane option | Includes express lane fee where applicable; quoted agent/service amount recorded in chat evidence | messages 487643, 487660 |

**Price notes:**
- The PHP 35,000 figure was recorded in the source chat as a practical implementation fee including an express lane option. Confirm the final quote at intake. Official BI fees are separate and charged by the Bureau.

---

## Important notes / Restrictions

- The agent cannot remove or lift an ALO/BLO by administrative work alone where a legal appeal or court order is required. For contested removals, the client must follow the ALO Lifting administrative path or retain legal counsel.
- Original documents may be temporarily held by the Bureau during processing; clients must plan around any travel that depends on those originals.
- Service timelines depend on immigration queue and availability of express channels; an express fee does not guarantee immediate completion and is subject to BI operational discretion.
