# 9G Work Visa Exit

## Summary

This service documents the practical steps and requirements for a holder of a valid 9G employer-sponsored work visa to depart the Philippines and re-enter as required. If the 9G endorsement (I-Card / BI order) remains valid the visa holder may exit and later return without downgrading. Typical users: current 9G visa cardholders who plan travel outside the Philippines and want to confirm boarding and immigration steps, fees and exit clearance details.

---

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to use this guidance:

- Geographic prerequisite: The traveler may be leaving from within the Philippines; exit procedures are performed at the airport or seaport. The guidance applies to exits from the Philippines and return travel to the Philippines on an existing 9G endorsement.
- Relationship prerequisite: The traveller must be the 9G visa holder (principal) or an authorised representative acting with clear employer authorization for case matters. Dependent rules may differ.
- Business prerequisite: The traveller must hold a valid passport and a valid 9G endorsement (I-Card and/or BI 9G order). If the 9G endorsement has expired or is under enforcement review, remedial immigration steps are required before travel.

Not eligible:
- Persons without a valid 9G endorsement recorded in BI.
- Persons with active enforcement flags (OTL, blacklist, DERO) that BI has not cleared.

## Required documents

### Documents the traveler must provide (must be supplied by client)

- Passport (original)
  - Type: original × 1
  - Requirements: Valid passport with sufficient validity and free pages. The passport will be presented to the airline and immigration; immigration may temporarily inspect or hold the passport during processing.
  - How used: Identity verification and boarding/immigration clearance.

- 9G I-Card or official BI 9G order (original or certified copy)
  - Type: original / certified copy × 1
  - Requirements: The holder must carry the BI I-Card or a certified copy of the BI 9G order to evidence active 9G status. This documentation is used to board flights and to present to Philippine immigration when returning.
  - How used: Presented to airline and immigration; required to avoid misclassification as a tourist on arrival.

### Documents we can produce

- None required from this advisory task. If the client lacks a 9G order copy, use the related service "9G Order Copy Request" (BureauOfImmigration/9g-order-copy-request.md) to obtain a certified copy from BI records.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Same-day actions at the airport; confirmation steps can be completed prior to travel.

### Step 1: Confirm 9G endorsement validity

**Estimated duration:** Minutes (before departure)

**Specific actions:**
1. Verify the 9G I-Card or BI order is valid and unexpired.
2. If uncertain about BI flags or record status, request a 9G Visa Status Check before travel.

**Needed documents:**
- Passport (copy) for status checks
- 9G I-Card or BI order reference

**Notes:**
- If the 9G endorsement has expired or there are pending enforcement issues, do not travel until the case is resolved.

---

### Step 2: At check-in and boarding (outbound)

**Estimated duration:** Airport check-in time per carrier

**Specific actions:**
1. Present passport and 9G I-Card / BI order to airline check-in staff. Some airlines require visible evidence of valid immigration status before permitting boarding.
2. Keep an employer letter or case contact available if airline staff request additional confirmation.

**Notes:**
- Airline policies vary; confirm carrier requirements in advance. Carry both the I-Card and a certified copy of the BI order if possible.

---

### Step 3: Pay departure/return charges (if applicable) and proceed through immigration

**Estimated duration:** Minutes at the airport

**Specific actions:**
1. Pay any required airport departure or return-related charge at the designated airport cashier or immigration counter.
2. Proceed to Philippine immigration on return and present passport and 9G I-Card / BI order. Immigration will verify the endorsement and admit the holder under the recorded 9G classification.

**Notes:**
- Evidence indicates there may be a small administrative departure/return charge for 9G holders. First-time return-related payments were reported around PHP 2,700–2,800 in chat evidence; subsequent payments were reported lower (examples: ~PHP 1,400–1,600). These amounts are operational reports and should be confirmed at the airport.
- ECC clearance is not required when departing on a valid 9G (per extracted evidence); do not assume additional ECC steps unless BI or employer instructs otherwise.

## Price & Fees

| Effective Date | Currency | Amount | Applicable Conditions | Notes | Evidence |
|---------------:|:-------:|------:|----------------------|------|---------:|
| 2024-02 | PHP | 2800 | First-time departure/return reported for 9G holders (approx.) | Operational evidence: first-time return charge around PHP 2,800; amounts may vary by airport and case | messages 510184, 510187 |

**Price notes:**
- The figures above come from internal chat evidence and are approximate operational observations. Confirm the exact payable amount at the airport immigration or with employer HR before travel.
- Official government or airport charges may change; agent handling fees (if any) are separate and will be quoted when agent assistance is required.

## Important notes

### Exit and downgrade
- Holders of a valid 9G work visa do not need to downgrade their visa simply to leave the Philippines. A valid 9G allows departure and subsequent re-entry (subject to airline acceptance and BI record status).

### ECC and other clearances
- According to extracted evidence, ECC or separate clearances are not required for routine exit when the principal holds a valid 9G endorsement. Always verify with BI or employer for case-specific exceptions.

### Fees and receipts
- Pay any departure/return fees at the airport cashier and retain official receipts. Receipts may be required for later BI interactions or employer reconciliation.

### Risk warnings
- Attempting to board without visible valid 9G evidence can result in denial by the airline. Use a certified BI order copy when I-Card is not yet issued or collected.
- If BI records show enforcement flags (OTL, blacklist, DERO), the traveller risks denial of boarding or entry; obtain a status check first.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I leave and return on a valid 9G without any special paperwork?**
A: Yes. If your 9G endorsement is valid, you can depart and re-enter the Philippines on the same classification. Confirm status before travel and carry your I-Card and passport.

**Q: Do I need ECC or a special exit clearance to leave?**
A: The extracted evidence indicates ECC is not required for routine exits by valid 9G holders. Confirm any case-specific requirements with BI or your employer.

**Q: How much is the airport departure/return charge?**
A: Chat evidence cites an approximate first-time amount of PHP 2,700–2,800 and lower amounts for subsequent payments (about PHP 1,400–1,600). Treat these as operational estimates and confirm at the airport.
