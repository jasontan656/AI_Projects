# Annual Report for Kids

## Summary

Annual Report for Kids is a simple Bureau of Immigration administrative procedure to record or confirm a child’s annual immigration status. The service is commonly used when a child's immigration record requires a yearly confirmation, registration, or a short in-person check (for example when the child is attached to a parent's visa or when BI requires annual registration). Typical users are parents, guardians, or authorized representatives managing dependent children's immigration records. The process usually begins with online registration to obtain a reference number, then — depending on the child's age — either an in-person appearance at the BI office or a short office-based payment and verification using the online reference. If the child is under 5 years old, personal attendance is commonly not required; for older children personal attendance may be required.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions before initiating an Annual Report for Kids:

- Geographic prerequisite: The parent/guardian or authorised representative should be able to visit the Bureau of Immigration office in the Philippines if the case requires in‑person attendance. Remote online registration is possible for the initial step.
- Relationship prerequisite: The requester must be the child's parent, legal guardian, or an authorised representative with written authorisation accepted by the Bureau of Immigration.
- Business prerequisite: The client must complete the online registration and obtain the BI reference number prior to any in‑office payment or verification step.

Not eligible:
- Adults (this process is specific to minor dependents and dependent records).
- Cases where no valid BI reference number is produced via the online registration (the reference number is the essential intake identifier).

## Required documents

### Documents the client must provide (cannot be produced by this service)

**Reference Number**
- Type: original / digital copy × 1
- Requirement: Reference number obtained from the BI online registration. This number must be presented at the main office when paying or verifying the child's annual record. The reference number cannot be produced by the agent — it must be generated by the client's online registration and shown at intake.
- How used: Primary identifier for the child's annual report; presented at the BI counter and used to locate the child's file.

**Child's Proof of Identity (when requested by BI)**
- Type: original / certified copy × 1
- Examples: child passport (if issued), PSA birth certificate, existing dependent I-Card or previous BI receipt.
- Requirement: Provide originals when BI requests physical verification; originals are normally returned after processing unless BI chooses to hold them for a short administrative period.

**Parent/Guardian ID**
- Type: original / copy × 1
- Requirement: Valid government ID or passport of the parent/guardian or authorised representative. If an authorised representative attends, a signed authorization (Special Power of Attorney) may be required by BI.

### Documents our service can produce

**Annual Report Acknowledgement**
- Document: administrative acknowledgement / receipt
- Producer: Annual Report for Kids
- Path: BureauOfImmigration/annual-report-for-kids.md
- Usage: Issued after BI payment/processing to confirm the child's annual report has been recorded. It is a service-produced administrative receipt and not a substitute for any official BI certificate.

## Process / Steps

**Estimated total duration:** Same day to a few business days depending on BI queue and whether an in‑office appearance is required.

### Step 1 — Online registration and reference number

**Estimated time:** 5–30 minutes

Specific actions:
1. Complete the Bureau of Immigration online registration form for the child's annual report. Provide accurate child and parent/guardian details.
2. Submit the online form and note or print the reference number generated by the system.
3. Save a digital screenshot or printout of the reference number for in‑office presentation.

**Documents needed:** None beyond the information entered online.

**Note:** The reference number is required before any in‑office payment or verification step.

---

### Step 2 — Determine need for in‑person attendance

**Estimated time:** Varies (immediate advisory by phone or email)

Specific actions:
1. Check the child's age and BI guidance: children under 5 years old typically do not need to appear at BI; children aged 5 and above commonly must attend in person for photo/verification.
2. If the child is under 5 and BI allows remote completion, proceed to Step 3. If BI requests an in‑person appearance, schedule a BI visit and prepare the child and parent/guardian to attend.

**Completion sign:** Decision documented: "appearance required" or "no appearance required." If appearance is required, book appointment.

---

### Step 3 — Office payment and verification

**Estimated time:** Same day to a few business days

Specific actions (if no personal appearance required):
1. The parent/guardian or authorised representative goes to the main BI office.
2. Present the reference number and required identification documents.
3. Pay the BI administrative fee (if any) and obtain an official BI receipt.

Specific actions (if personal appearance required):
1. Child and parent/guardian attend the BI office at the scheduled time.
2. BI performs any required short verification (photo capture, form signing) and accepts payment.
3. Obtain BI acknowledgement and internal reference receipt.

**Documents needed:** Reference number, parent/guardian ID, child's proof of identity when requested.

**Completion sign:** BI issues official receipt or acknowledgement showing the child's annual report is recorded.

---

### Step 4 — If represented: Special Power of Attorney (SPA)

**Estimated time:** Same day to 1 business day

Specific actions:
1. If the authorised representative attends in place of the parent(s), prepare a signed Special Power of Attorney (SPA) appointing the named agent to act for the child on the specific annual report task.
2. Present SPA and representative ID at BI if BI requests evidence of authorisation.

**Note:** BI may reject third‑party representation depending on local practices. Confirm acceptance with BI before relying on representation.

## Fees & Payment

No fixed service fee for the agent is recorded in the extracted evidence. Official BI fees (if applicable) are payable to the Bureau of Immigration at the time of in‑office payment. Confirm the current BI charge during intake. Agent handling fees (if the client requests representation) are quoted at engagement.

**Price note:** The original chat evidence does not list a published BI fee for the child's annual report. Expect BI counter payment instructions at the time of the in‑office step.

## Important notes / Limitations

- Children under 5 years old commonly do not need to appear in person — verify with the specific BI office handling the case.
- Children aged 5 years and older typically must attend the BI office for photo capture and short verification.
- If the child will be brought by an authorised representative rather than the parent(s), BI often requires a signed Special Power of Attorney (SPA) authorising the representative; prepare the SPA in advance.
- Always keep the BI reference number safe — it is the core intake identifier.

---

## Risks & Advice

- Failing to present correct identity documents or the BI reference number may result in reporting delays. Gather required documents before going to the BI counter.
- If the child is required to attend and the child does not appear, BI may delay the record update and request re‑scheduling.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Does my child need to be present for the annual report?**
A: It depends on age and BI rules. Based on the available evidence, children aged 5 and older commonly must appear in person; children under 5 usually do not need to appear. Confirm with BI or at intake.

**Q: What is the reference number and how do I get it?**
A: The reference number is produced by the Bureau of Immigration online registration system. Complete the child annual report online form to obtain the reference number; you must present it at the BI counter during payment or verification.

**Q: Can someone else bring the child or handle the report on my behalf?**
A: Yes, an authorised representative may act if BI accepts a Special Power of Attorney (SPA) or other written authorisation. Confirm BI's representation policy in advance.
