# 9G Downgrade and I-Card Cancellation

## Summary

This service handles the administrative process to downgrade a 9G work visa classification and to cancel the associated I-Card with the Philippine Bureau of Immigration (BI). Typical users are foreign nationals whose employment-based 9G status is ending or has ended and who must formally close their BI record and surrender/cancel the I-Card. The service verifies the client's situation, assembles required documents, submits the cancellation/downgrade request to BI, coordinates passport handling and delivery, and returns the passport and any BI receipts to the client. Typical processing time is approximately 7 working days depending on BI workload.

## Background prerequisites

Customers must meet the following conditions to request this service:

- Geographic prerequisite: The principal or an authorized local representative must be available in the Philippines for submission steps that require originals or in-person verification. Some preparatory steps can be done remotely by sending scanned documents.
- Relationship prerequisite: None beyond being the 9G visa holder or an authorized representative acting on the visa holder's behalf.
- Business prerequisite: Client must hold a passport and have records of their 9G / I-Card. If the client's case requires an official Order to Leave (OTL) or other downgrading order, that document must be provided or produced by a related downgrading service before cancellation can proceed.

Not eligible:
- Cases where the client is outside the Philippines and cannot provide an authorized representative where BI explicitly requires the principal's personal attendance.
- Cases that require immigration litigation or contested enforcement appeals (these require legal counsel beyond administrative cancellation).

## Required documents

### Documents the client must provide (must be supplied by client)

- Passport bio page (copy × 1)
  - Type: copy × 1
  - Requirement: Clear copy of the passport biographical page showing name, passport number and expiry. Used to verify identity and to prepare BI submission.
  - Handling: Copy retained in case file; original passport may still be required for BI submission depending on BI instructions.

- Order (original × 1)
  - Type: original × 1
  - Requirement: An original Order document that BI requires as part of the downgrading or closure (for example an Order to Leave or equivalent BI/DOJ paperwork). If the client does not have this, a related downgrading service (for example 47a2 Visa Downgrading) may produce it.
  - Handling: Submitted to BI as required; may be collected by BI during processing.

- I-Card (both sides) (copy × 1)
  - Type: copy × 1
  - Requirement: Clear copies of the front and back of the I-Card to support cancellation and BI record update.
  - Handling: Copies used in the submission. If BI requires the original I-Card, the client must provide it for surrender/collection.

- Date of last entry as tourist (information)
  - Type: information × 1
  - Requirement: Provide the date of the client's last entry into the Philippines as a tourist (if applicable). This is used to verify status history and compute any required procedural steps.

Notes:
- Originals may be required by BI in some cases. If BI requests the passport or I-Card original for surrender or validation, the client will be asked to deliver the original passport and/or I-Card in person or via a secure courier.

### Documents that can be produced by our services

- Order to Leave / Downgrading documentation
  - If the client lacks the required 'Order' original, this document can sometimes be produced by a separate administrative downgrading service: 47a2 Visa Downgrading (BureauOfImmigration/47a2-visa-downgrading.md). That related service coordinates with DOJ/BI and can produce the necessary official order that this cancellation task requires.

- If an I-Card replacement or other I-Card related documents are required prior to cancellation or closure, related services such as 9G Application or 13A I-Card Replacement (where applicable by visa class) may be relevant. Confirm the exact producer during intake.

## Documents obtained after completion

- BI I-Card cancellation confirmation / acknowledgment (copy)
  - Type: official acknowledgment or receipt (copy)
  - Use: Proof that BI processed the I-Card cancellation and updated its records. Keep this with your immigration records.

- Updated BI record / submission receipt (original or copy)
  - Type: official receipt or BI note
  - Use: Evidence the downgrade/cancellation request was filed and processed. Required for downstream tasks such as ECC or exit clearances.

- Returned passport (original) with any BI endorsements or release notes (if passport was submitted)
  - Type: original passport returned
  - Use: Primary travel document returned after BI releases it.

## Process / Steps

**Total estimated duration:** Approximately 7 working days (subject to BI workload and queue).

### Step 1: Intake and document confirmation

**Estimated duration:** 1 business day

Specific actions:
1. Client submits copies of passport bio page, I-Card (both sides) and provides the original Order if available. Provide the date of last entry information.
2. Agent reviews submitted documents and confirms whether the file is complete or if an Order must be produced by a related downgrading service (for example 47a2 Visa Downgrading).

**Required documents:** passport copy, I-Card copy, Order (if available), date of last entry.

**Notes:** If the Order is missing, advise the client to obtain it via the related service, or include the downgrading service as an additional task in the engagement.

---

### Step 2: Deliver passport and originals (if BI requires originals)

**Estimated duration:** same day or as scheduled

Specific actions:
1. Once documents are confirmed, deliver the passport and any originals personally or via a secure courier (e.g., Lalamove) if BI requires original submission or surrender of the I-Card.
2. Obtain handover receipt and record chain-of-custody.

**Notes:** Agents typically accept passport delivery by appointment or secure courier. Confirm delivery method and timing with the client.

---

### Step 3: Submission to Bureau of Immigration and payment

**Estimated duration:** submission day; BI processing ~7 working days

Specific actions:
1. Prepare the BI submission packet for 9G downgrade and I-Card cancellation using provided originals/copies.
2. Submit to BI and pay any official BI fees. Agent handling fee payment instructions: bank deposit in advance or payment upon passport delivery, as agreed.
3. Monitor BI case and follow up until BI provides cancellation confirmation and releases passport back to agent/client.

**Completion sign:** BI issues an official cancellation acknowledgment or returns passport with relevant endorsements.

---

### Step 4: Return of passport and delivery of evidence

**Estimated duration:** same day as BI release

Specific actions:
1. Collect passport and cancellation acknowledgment from BI.
2. Deliver the passport and copies of BI receipts to the client. Provide a short completion report summarizing actions and next steps (if any).

## Important notes / Risks

### Processing limitations
- BI workload may extend processing beyond the typical 7 working days. Expect variability.
- Some cases trigger additional BI or DOJ requirements (for example fines, additional documentary evidence) which will delay completion and may incur extra costs.

### Document custody
- BI may temporarily hold originals (passport, I-Card, order) during processing. Clients should be prepared for temporary surrender of originals and plan travel accordingly.

### Risk warnings
- If the client's immigration history contains unresolved enforcement flags (overstays, prior OTL, active notices), BI may require more complex remediation or escalate the case. In such cases, legal or advanced immigration support may be required.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How long does the cancellation take?**
A: Typical processing is around 7 working days but can be longer depending on BI workload and any additional checks required.

A: Yes. The principal or an authorized local representative generally must be available in the Philippines for any step requiring originals or personal attendance.

**Q: What happens if I don't have the 'Order' original?**
A: If the required 'Order' document is missing, you may need to obtain it via a related downgrading service (for example 47a2 Visa Downgrading). We can coordinate that additional service for you.
